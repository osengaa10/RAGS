Q1:
A 65-year-old woman is found to have microscopic hematuria on a urinalysis done for a work physical. 
A follow-up cystoscopy shows a low-grade Ta bladder tumor. 
What is the appropriate treatment?

A1:
TURBT followed by intravesical mitomycin. Although it is a low-grade
tumor, it still requires resection. However, a single dose of intravesical
chemotherapy should be sufficient to reduce recurrence.

================================================================

Q2:
A 65-year-old woman is diagnosed with metastatic bladder cancer. She has
a history of hypertension and chronic kidney disease with baseline creatinine of 2. Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) score is <1% and she has a
FGFR2 mutation on next-generation sequencing.
What is the appropriate first-line treatment?

A2:
Carboplatin + gemcitabine. Due to her chronic kidney disease (CKD),
she would be considered cisplatin-ineligible. Platinum-based treatment
would be still be preferable, and therefore carboplatin plus gemcitabine
is the preferred regimen. PD-L1 score is too low for upfront checkpoint
inhibitor therapy. Given the FGFR2 mutation, erdafitinib could be considered second-line but would not be used for front-line therapy.

================================================================

Q3:
A 54-year-old man presents with gross hematuria. He undergoes transurethral
resection of bladder tumor (TURBT), which diagnoses muscle-invasive (T2) bladder cancer. He has no comorbidities; however, he strongly prefers to not have a
urostomy. What would be the optimal management of his bladder cancer?

A3:
Chemoradiation with cisplatin and 5-FU. Recommended options
for muscle-invasive bladder cancer include cystectomy and chemoradiation. Because this patient prefers to avoid cystectomy, bladder-sparing
options should be considered. Chemoradiation with doublet chemotherapy is preferred

================================================================

Q4:
A 84-year-old man is diagnosed with metastatic bladder cancer. He is initially
treated with gemcitabine and carboplatin due to a history of diabetic neuropathy. He has no other comorbidities and excellent functional status. After six
cycles of treatment, imaging demonstrates a partial response to treatment. What management would be recommended next?

A4:
Avelumab maintenance. Per the Javelin 100 study, maintenance immunotherapy with avelumab was shown to prolong overall survival following
four to six cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy if disease has not progressed. Avelumab maintenance was shown to be superior to best supportive care in the overall and PD-L1 positive populations, so PD-L1 testing
is not necessary prior to starting avelumab.

================================================================
Maybe not be a good question...
Q5:
. A 69-year-old man is treated for localized T1 bladder cancer with bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG). On repeat transurethral resection of bladder
tumor (TURBT), he appears to have residual disease. Pathology is consistent with urothelial carcinoma without invasion of muscularis propria
(muscularis propria is present on the specimen, however). What treatment would not be considered for his BCG-refractory bladder
cancer?

A5:
Cisplatin. Options for management of T1 bladder cancer refractory to
BCG include intravesicular chemotherapy, pembrolizumab, or cystectomy.
Systemic cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimens are not used in this
setting

================================================================

Q6:
A 62-year-old man develops hematuria and is referred to a urologist.
Staging cystoscopy reveals a sessile bladder tumor. Pathology from the
transurethral resection shows high-grade urothelial carcinoma invading the
lamina propria but no muscle is included in the sample and is staged as T1.
Which therapy would you recommend?

A6:
Repeat staging with TURBT. There was no muscle included in the
sample and treatment depends on whether invasion into the muscularis
propria is present or not.
