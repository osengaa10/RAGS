Q1:
A 65-year-old woman is found to have microscopic hematuria on a urinalysis done for a work physical. A follow-up cystoscopy shows a low-grade Ta bladder tumor. What is the appropriate treatment?

A1:
TURBT followed by intravesical mitomycin. Although it is a low-grade tumor, it still requires resection. However, a single dose of intravesical chemotherapy should be sufficient to reduce recurrence.


Q2:
A 65-year-old woman is diagnosed with metastatic bladder cancer. She has a history of hypertension and chronic kidney disease with baseline creatinine of 2. Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) score is <1% and she has a FGFR2 mutation on next-generation sequencing. What is the appropriate first-line treatment?

A2:
Carboplatin + gemcitabine. Due to her chronic kidney disease (CKD), she would be considered cisplatin-ineligible. Platinum-based treatment would be still be preferable, and therefore carboplatin plus gemcitabine is the preferred regimen. PD-L1 score is too low for upfront checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Given the FGFR2 mutation, erdafitinib could be considered second-line but would not be used for front-line therapy.


Q3 (good):
A 54-year-old man presents with gross hematuria. He undergoes transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT), which diagnoses muscle-invasive (T2) bladder cancer. He has no comorbidities; however, he strongly prefers to not have a urostomy. What would be the optimal management of his bladder cancer?

A3 (good):
Chemoradiation with cisplatin and 5-FU. Recommended options for muscle-invasive bladder cancer include cystectomy and chemoradiation. Because this patient prefers to avoid cystectomy, bladder-sparing options should be considered. Chemoradiation with doublet chemotherapy is preferred


Q4:
A 84-year-old man is diagnosed with metastatic bladder cancer. He is initially treated with gemcitabine and carboplatin due to a history of diabetic neuropathy. He has no other comorbidities and excellent functional status. After six cycles of treatment, imaging demonstrates a partial response to treatment. What management would be recommended next?

A4:
Avelumab maintenance. Per the Javelin 100 study, maintenance immunotherapy with avelumab was shown to prolong overall survival following four to six cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy if disease has not progressed. Avelumab maintenance was shown to be superior to best supportive care in the overall and PD-L1 positive populations, so PD-L1 testing is not necessary prior to starting avelumab.


Q5:
A 62-year-old man develops hematuria and is referred to a urologist. Staging cystoscopy reveals a sessile bladder tumor. Pathology from the transurethral resection shows high-grade urothelial carcinoma invading the lamina propria but no muscle is included in the sample and is staged as T1. Which therapy would you recommend?

A5:
Repeat staging with TURBT. There was no muscle included in the sample and treatment depends on whether invasion into the muscularis propria is present or not.

Q1:
A 24-year-old woman is diagnosed with a right ovarian yolk sac (endodermal sinus) tumor with ovarian capsule rupture. Postoperative alpha-fetoprotein is 500. CT imaging of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis is without evidence of disease. What is the best next step in treatment?

A1:
Intravenous cisplatin and etoposide every 3 weeks with weekly bleomycin for first three to four cycles. Germ cell tumors of the ovary are treated similarly to germ cell tumors of the testes. In yolk sac tumors, which are a high-risk germ cell tumor, adjuvant chemotherapy with bleomycin, cisplatin, and etoposide is indicated for even early-stage, resected disease.


Q2:
A 49-year-old woman with a history of high-grade serious adenocarcinoma of the ovary and a deleterious BRCA1 mutation has just completed carbo- platin and paclitaxel for her first platinum-sensitive recurrence. What is the recommended maintenance therapy for this patient?

A2:
PARP inhibitor therapy. Maintenance therapy with PARP inhibitor is now indicated for all patients following completion of a platinum-based regimen for their first platinum-sensitive recurrence. Improvement in clini- cal outcomes is greatest for women with BRCA mutations or homologous recombination deficient (HRD). Weekly paclitaxel maintenance therapy has been tested in the clinical trial setting and not shown to improve outcomes. Maintenance bevacizumab should only be continued in select patients who received bevacizumab with their primary therapy.

Q1:
A 25-year-old female diagnosed with stage IIIA classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) has completed two cycles of treatment with Adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine (ABVD). An interim PET/CT is performed, with Deauville response score 2. What is the most appropriate next step in therapy?

A1:
Continue treatment with four additional cycles of AVD. A Deauville score of 2 is considered negative, and a good prognostic indicator following initial two cycles of ABVD, however further therapy is required. As per the response-adapted therapy for advanced Hodgkin lymphoma (RATHL) trial, bleomycin may be omitted from further cycles of treatment.


Q2:
An otherwise healthy 45-year-old male completed six cycles of Adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine (ABVD) for stage IV classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL). Six months following completion of treatment, he noticed an enlarging cervical lymph node. Biopsy was performed, which confirmed relapse. PET/CT shows diffuse disease. What is the most appropriate next step in management?

A2:
Initiate salvage chemotherapy with ifosfamide/carboplatin/etoposide (ICE) and plan for autologous stem cell transplant (autoSCT). Standard initial treatment for relapsed cHL is salvage chemotherapy (such as ICE) followed by autoSCT. Retreating with a combination chemotherapy regi- men without autoSCT would not be indicated with a relapse this early. Brentuximab and allogeneic stem cell transplant are indicated in patients relapsing following autoSCT.


Q3:
An 81-year-old male is diagnosed with stage IVA classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL). He has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 2. He wishes to pursue therapy for his lymphoma if possible but is concerned with quality of life in the setting of his comorbid- ities and current frailty. He has a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease. Which of the following would be the most reasonable treatment recommendation?

A3:
Treatment with combination of brentuximab vedotin and nivolumab. Emerging data have shown the combination of brentuximab vedotin and nivolumab to have high response rates with acceptable toxicity profile in elderly/frail patients with advanced stage cHL.

Q1:
A 64-year-old woman with a history of stage IIIC1 endometrioid endometrial cancer and known Lynch syndrome with MSH2 gene mutation presents with multifocal recurrent disease. Four months ago she completed primary therapy consisting of surgical staging, followed by carboplatin and paclitaxel chemotherapy with radiation. She has no other medical problems and her performance status is excellent. What next step in treatment has the highest response rate?

A1:
Pembrolizumab. Pembrolizumab is approved for the treatment of microsatellite instability high (MSI-H)/deficient mismatch repair (dMMR) tumors that have progressed on prior treatment. Given this patient’s MSH2 gene mutation and her prior carboplatin/paclitaxel chemotherapy, she is an excellent candidate for pembrolizumab as the next treatment approach. In a patient with recurrent disease that is not MSI-H/dMMR, pembrolizumab plus lenvatinib is a treatment option, generally after carboplatin and paclitaxel chemotherapy.


Q2:
A 59-year-old woman presents with postmenopausal bleeding and endometrial biopsy reveals grade 2 endometrioid endometrial cancer. She has a history of severe cardiopulmonary disease and a body mass index of 76 kg/m2; she has not been cleared for hysterectomy. CT and MRI demonstrate disease confined to the uterus. What is the best long-term treatment approach for her cancer?

A2:
Primary radiation. For uterus-confined disease, radiation therapy can be as effective as surgery for treatment of endometrial cancer. Given this patient’s comorbidities, including her obesity, radiation is much safer than surgery. Although progesterone therapy (via intrauterine device or orally) can lead to regression of disease, response rates are lower with grade 2 disease and it is only a temporizing approach rather than definitive therapy. Finally, systemic chemotherapy has much greater toxicity and would not be recommended for local disease.

Q1:
A 58-year-old woman has multiple liver lesions identified in a CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis obtained during a routine workup for abdominal pain. There was no evidence of a primary tumor. A core biopsy of one of the liver lesions is performed, revealing a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with the following immunohistochemistry profile: CK 7 negative, CK 20 positive, CDX2 positive. Which of the following is the most likely primary site?

A1:
Colorectal. Immunohistochemical stains can often guide diagnosis of a primary site. Cytokeratin stains are a helpful first triage point. CK 7-negative/CK 20-positive tumors are often colorectal, Merkel cell, or gastric primaries. CDX2 is very specific for colorectal tumors.


Q2:
A 68-year-old woman is found to have two intraabdominal masses on a CT abdomen and pelvis obtained for abdominal discomfort. Biopsy of one of the masses reveals a poorly differentiated carcinoma. Immunohistochemical staining for mismatch repair proteins demonstrates loss of PMS2 and MLH1 and retained staining for MSH2 and MSH6. Which systemic therapy options would have the highest response rate?

A2:
Pembrolizumab. Traditional platinum-based chemotherapy regimens have a <30% response rate in CUPs. This patient has a mismatch repair deficient tumor for which pembrolizumab has a 34.3% objective response rate in advanced, noncolorectal mismatch repair-deficient/microsatellite instability-high tumors.

STEMCELL AND BONE MARROW TRANSPLANT
================================================================
================================================================

Q1:
A 57-year-old woman is 145 days from a matched unrelated stem cell transplant for high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome. Her early transplant course was complicated by a severe viral pneumonia and gastrointestinal (GI) acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), which was treated with steroids with good improvement. She presents to clinic today complaining of progressive dry eyes and dry mouth as well as muscle and joint tightness. Her exam is notable for a mild weight loss of 2 kg, irritation of bilateral sclera, and an oropharynx that appears dry with lichenoid changes. She has limited range of motion of both her arms but no muscle tenderness on exam. She remains on tacrolimus for GVHD prophylaxis but this has been tapered. In addition, she continues to take acyclovir, fluconazole, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole for infectious disease prophylaxis. What is the most likely diagnosis?

A1:
Chronic GVHD. Her symptoms of dry eyes, dry mouth, and joint tightness are classic for symptoms of chronic GVHD, as is her exam demonstrating irritated sclera and lichenoid changes in her oropharynx. This is an appropriate time frame for chronic GVHD to begin and her history of prior acute GVHD as well as her unrelated donor transplant are both risk factors for development of chronic GVHD. While the symptoms of dry eyes and dry mouth in a patient who had not previously undergone allogeneic stem cell transplant may be suggestive of Sjögren syndrome, GVHD is a better explanation in this case. Viral etiologies can certainly have a protean presentation of symptoms, but viral ulcerations in the oral cavity tend to be painful and not lichenoid. Tacrolimus does not cause dry eyes, dry mouth, or arthralgias. More commonly, it results in renal wasting of magnesium and rarely microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, neurologic changes, or renal dysfunction. More importantly, the patient’s tacrolimus is being tapered suggesting her symptoms are related to the withdrawal of this immunosuppressant (i.e., GVHD) and are not a symptom of the medication itself.

LYMPHOCYTIC LEUKEMIA
================================================================
================================================================


Q1:
A 58-year-old female with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) presents with fevers, severe fatigue, and frequent night sweats. Her complete blood count (CBC) is significant for a white blood cell (WBC) count of 135 × 109/L, absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) of 110 × 109/L, hemoglobin of 9 g/dL, and platelet count of 97 × 109/L. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) testing positive for del(17p). She is initiated on ibrutinib 420 mg daily and has mild diarrhea but otherwise tolerates therapy in his first week. On her subsequent labs in 2 weeks, her WBC has increased to 160 × 109/L, ALC 135 × 109/L, with stable hemoglobin and platelet counts. In 1 month, her WBC has increased to 230 × 109/L, ALC 210 × 109/L, hemoglobin and platelet counts remain stable. Her fevers and night sweats have resolved. What is the next appropriate step in management of her CLL?


A1:
Continue ibrutinib 420 mg PO daily. Increased peripheral lymphocytosis after initiating treatment with ibrutinib therapy is common and may last for several months. The development of peripheral lymphocytosis secondary to ibrutinib was due to mobilization of CLL cells from bone marrow and lymphoid organs. It has not been shown to be detrimental to long-term clinical outcomes.


Q2:
A 47-year-old woman with known chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) presents to clinic with worsening lymphadenopathy, night sweats, and shortness of breath. Her white blood cell (WBC) count is 102 × 109/L, hemoglobin 8 g/dL, and platelet count 90 × 109/L. A CT scan of the chest/abdomen/pelvis demonstrates bulky lymphadenopathy in her cervical, axillary, retroperitoneal, and mesenteric lymph nodes. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) testing demonstrates a deletion 17p. She has not been previously treated for her CLL. What be the most appropriate frontline therapy option?

A2:
Ibrutinib. This has been shown to have high overall response rates in deletion 17p patients and is currently a preferred first-line therapy. Deletion 17p and patients with TP53 mutations have poor outcomes with conventional chemoimmunotherapy regimens.

Q1:
A 47-year-old Jamaican man presents with an elevated lymphocyte count and peripheral blood shows some cells with hyperlobated nuclei appearing like clovers. Which pathogen is typically associated with this peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) subtype?

A1:
HTLV-1. This man most likely has adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) given his heritage and peripheral blood features; this is associated with HTLV-1 infection.

Q1:
A 35-year-old female presents to her primary care physician with shortness of breath that persists despite treatment for pneumonia with antibiotics and an albuterol inhaler. Primary care physician orders a CT of the thorax that demonstrates a 6 × 10 cm mediastinal mass which is redemonstrated on PET/CT. Biopsy is positive for a primary mediastinal B cell lymphoma. She receives six cycles of DA-EPOCH-P. PET/CT completed 4 weeks after therapy demonstrates a residual mass. What is the appropriate next step?

A1:
Repeat biopsy of the residual mass to ensure persistent disease. Residual masses in the mediastinum are common after treatment of primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBL) therefore it is important to confirm the presence of disease with a biopsy prior to additional therapy.


Q2:
A 69-year-old male presents with night sweats and weight loss. He is found to have diffuse lymphadenopathy above and below the diaphragm. He underdoes an excisional lymph node biopsy of an axillary node, which is consistent with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Hepatitis serology negative for hepatitis B surface antigen but positive for hepatitis core antibody. Hepatitis B polymerase chain reaction (PCR) viral load is negative. Liver function testing is normal. What is recommended while treating with rituximab therapy?

A2:
Entecavir while receiving rituximab on and for 12 months after completion of rituximab therapy. Rituximab has a risk of reactivating hepatitis B and therefore patients with hepatitis B surface antigen or core IgG or core IgM positivity with negative hepatitis B PCR viral load, prophylaxis with Entecavir during and for 12 months after treatment is recommended to prevent reactivation. Lamivudine should be avoided due to resistance.


Q3: (long shot)
A 56-year-old female presents to the ED with 4 weeks of an enlarging left cervical lymph node, night sweats, and 20 pound weight loss over 1 month. On exam, there is a 5 × 6 cm left cervical lymph node, palpable right cervical lymph nodes. Serum lactate dehydrogenase 850 (normal range 100–240 U/L). Core needle biopsy of left cervical lymph node with effacement of nodal architecture with lymphoid proliferation. Immunohistochemistry with neoplastic cells expressing CD20, CD10, BCL2 60%, MYC >50%, BCL 6 but not expressing MUM1. Ki67 95%. What additional testing is required to make a diagnosis and determine therapy?


A3:
Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for MYC, BCL2, BCL6. Patient has an aggressive B-cell germinal center neoplasm. FISH for MYC, BCL2, BCL6 will distinguish between a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, GC type, high-grade B-cell lymphoma, double/triple hit, and Burkitt lymphoma. If FISH is positive for MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6, diagnosis is a high-grade B-cell lymphoma treated with DA-EPOCH and CNS prophylaxis. If FISH is negative for MYC, diagnosis is diffuse large B-cell lymphoma treated with R-CHOP. If FISH is positive for only MYC, a diagnosis of Burkitt lymphoma should be considered with treatment of R-Hyper-CVAD plus CNS treatment if involved or CNS prophylaxis if uninvolved.

Q1 (HARD):
A 65-year-old woman underwent a radical nephrectomy for a right kidney mass 2 years ago, initially identified by CT scan during a workup by her primary care physician for painless hematuria. Pathology revealed a 9 cm renal cell carcinoma (RCC), clear cell histology, with 4 of 10 lymph nodes involved by neoplasm. She was observed clinically after the operation. She is referred to you now after a CT obtained for right-sided abdominal pain showed five liver lesions measuring 2 cm each, and scattered noncalcified pulmonary nodules in both lungs. CT-guided core biopsy of one of the liver lesions showed clear cell carcinoma consistent with the histopathology of the primary kidney tumor removed 2 years ago. She has a history of coronary artery disease and well-controlled hypertension and takes a thiazide diuretic as well as aspirin. Her abdominal pain is well controlled with oral analgesics and she is otherwise asymptomatic. Her Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status is 0. What would you recommend next?

A1 (HARD):
Ipilimumab/nivolumab. This patient has metastatic RCC, clear cell type. Combination ipilimumab/nivolumab is an effective frontline therapy for metastatic RCC of clear cell type, particularly in intermediate and poor-risk patients. It has superior overall survival and progression-free survival compared to sunitinib, a vascular endothelial growth factor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (VEGF-TKI). Nivolumab, an anti-programmed death-1 antibody, has demonstrated prolonged overall survival compared to everolimus as a second-line therapy after progression on an initial VEGF-TKI. Combination immunotherapy with VEGF-TKI, such as pembrolizumab/axitinib or avelumab/axitinib, is an alternative frontline therapy option for metastatic RCC. Pembrolizumab/pazopanib is not a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved combination therapy. High-dose IL-2 can induce durable remissions in a minority of patients with metastatic RCC; however, the patient’s age, medical history, and volume of metastases make her a poor IL-2 candidate. Her volume and distribution of disease make metastasectomy a poor option. Cytotoxic chemotherapy is considered ineffective in metastatic kidney cancer.

Q2 (biology related):
A 51-year-old man, former smoker, presented to the ED complaining of acute onset left flank pain. Past medical history is significant for spontaneous pneumothoraces requiring bilateral thoracotomies and pleurodesis, and right upper lobectomy at 22 years old. Family history is significant for emphysema in mother, aunt, sister, and a son with history of pneumothorax. CT imaging on admission revealed a 0.5 cm kidney stone in the left mid-ureter and an indeterminate 3 cm lesion on the right kidney. He was eventually discharged with outpatient follow-up. During active surveillance, his right kidney mass increases in size. He is referred to urology for further evaluation. The patient undergoes a right radical nephrectomy with pathology revealing a diagnosis of chromophobe renal cell carcinoma. What gene mutations is associated with this patient’s condition?

A2:
FLCN. This patient has Birt–Hogg–Dubé (BHD) syndrome, which is a hereditary condition characterized by a mutation in the folliculin (FLCN) gene. The disease can be manifested by pulmonary cysts leading to pneumothoraces, benign skin tumors, and renal cell carcinoma that is predominantly chromophobe and/or oncocytoma type. Genetic mutations in MET and FH are commonly associated with papillary-type renal cell carcinoma. The mutation associated with succinate dehydrogenase is associated with hereditary paraganglioma and pheochromocytoma (HPP) and predisposes to clear cell and chromophobe RCC. Sickle cell trait/disease, characterized by a point mutation in the HBB gene, predisposes to renal medullary carcinoma, a highly aggressive malignancy.

Q1:
A 62-year-old patient returns to your office for continued management of his previously painful bone-only, castration-resistant metastatic prostate cancer. He is asymptomatic and has been maintained on continuous leuprolide while zoledronic acid and abiraterone + prednisone were added 6 months ago when he became castration-resistant. The addition of abiraterone + prednisone decreased his prostate-specific antigen (PSA) from 87 ng/mL to 65 ng/mL after 3 months and his pain improved. The PSA has risen today to 130 ng/mL. A CT of the chest/abdomen/pelvis was obtained, which shows two new suspicious liver lesions. His bone scan described more intense uptake in three different lesions that were previously seen but no new lesions. Biopsy of a liver lesion confirms metastatic prostate cancer and next-generation sequencing reveals no homologous repair deficiencies. What would be an appropriate next therapy for his progressive disease?

A1:
Docetaxel. The patient has castration-resistant metastatic prostate cancer that initially responded to secondary hormonal therapy but has now progressed with new visceral metastatic disease and rapidly rising PSA. He appropriately underwent genetic testing; however, had no homologous repair deficiency so olaparib is inappropriate (choice C). Radium-223 is approved only for bone-only metastatic disease so confirmed liver lesions prohibit this option (choice D). Continuing abiraterone and switching to denosumab is inappropriate as he is having visceral progression has not any skeletal events on zoledronic acid (choice B). Switching to first-line chemotherapy with docetaxel is the most appropriate option in this patient.


Q2:
A 64-year-old man is diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer when an x-ray for persistent lumbar back pain showed a sclerotic lesion in L4. Subsequent workup revealed a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) of 107 ng/mL. A CT with enlarged pelvic lymph nodes and prostate, and bone scan showed innumerous sclerotic lesions, including in L4, T4, left 12 rib, and right scapula. He is otherwise healthy. He has been on bicalu­ tamide for 2 weeks that was prescribed by his urologist. What is the best treatment plan?

A2:
Add leuprolide and six cycles of docetaxel. He has high-volume (defined as visceral disease or at least four bone metastases with one beyond vertebral body/pelvis) de novo metastatic prostate cancer. This chemohormonal strategy of adding six cycles of docetaxel to traditional androgen deprivation therapy improves overall survival. The addition of abiraterone, enzalutamide, or apalutamide would also have been appropriate. Choice E, the addition of radiation to the prostate is not appropriate since the patient does not have a low volume of disease.

Q3:
A 78-year-old man without comorbid conditions, but with metastatic ­prostate cancer to the bone, is coming to your office for regular ­follow-up. His primary disease was treated with external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) 10 years ago. He developed recurrence with bone metastases 3 years ago and was started on androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and abiraterone + prednisone with a good response. After 18 months of treatment, he became castration-resistant based on rising PSA and several new bone lesions on bone scan involving his spine and appendicular skeleton. CT scans show no visceral disease. He remains asymptomatic and regularly goes for long walks. What would be an appropriate next step for his treatment?

A3:
Radium-223 This patient has progressive disease, which has newly become castration resistant. He currently has evidence of bone-only disease with no visceral lesions. As he appears to have good functional status and has not received any treatment for metastatic castration-resistant disease so supportive care alone is likely not appropriate. Increasing abiraterone dose is not recommended for progression. Cabazitaxel is approved after progression on Docetaxel but would be inappropriate for this patient. While all patients with castrate-resistant disease and bone mets should receive a bisphosphonate, only zoledronic acid, not pamidronate is approved for prostate cancer. Docetaxel would be an appropriate option but with zoledronic acid or denosumab, not pamidronate. Radium-223 is an approved treatment for men with bone-only castrate-resistant disease and the most appropriate of the listed options.
