    "Based on the information provided, TREATMENT 3 is the most similar to the Control Treatment. The Control Treatment involves using a platinum-based treatment due to the patient's chronic kidney disease, and TREATMENT 3 also involves using a specific treatment (erdafitinib) due to the patient's FGFR2 mutation. Both treatments require close monitoring of renal function and blood pressure. TREATMENT 1 and TREATMENT 2 involve different treatments (erdafitinib and a molecularly targeted agent, respectively) and do not mention the need for a platinum-based treatment.",
    "Based on the information provided, TREATMENT 1 and TREATMENT 2 are the most similar to the Control Treatment. Both of these treatments involve maximal safe TURBT followed by concurrent chemoradiation therapy, which is the same approach as the Control Treatment. The chemotherapy regimens used in these treatments include cisplatin, which is also used in the Control Treatment. TREATMENT 3, on the other hand, involves neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy and concurrent chemotherapy, which is different from the Control Treatment. Therefore, TREATMENT 1 and TREATMENT 2 are more similar to the Control Treatment than TREATMENT 3.",
    "Based on the information provided, TREATMENT 1 and TREATMENT 2 are the most similar to the Control Treatment. Both of these treatments recommend initiating salvage chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) for the patient with relapsed stage IV cHL. The recommended salvage chemotherapy regimens include ICE and DHAP, which are also mentioned in the Control Treatment.\n\nTREATMENT 3, on the other hand, suggests the consideration of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) in case of repeated relapse, which is not mentioned in the Control Treatment. Additionally, TREATMENT 3 mentions the use of gemcitabine-based chemotherapy and/or regional radiotherapy for patients with progressive, resistant disease in a palliative situation, which is not mentioned in the Control Treatment.\n\nTherefore, TREATMENT 1 and TREATMENT 2 are more similar to the Control Treatment compared to TREATMENT 3.",
    "Based on the information provided, TREATMENT 2 is the most similar to the Control Treatment. The Control Treatment involves the use of a combination of brentuximab vedotin and nivolumab, which are both immunotherapy drugs. TREATMENT 2 does not involve the use of these specific drugs, but it does involve the use of a reduced-toxicity regimen of ABVD chemotherapy (doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine) followed by involved-site radiotherapy in patients with a positive PET scan after 2 cycles of chemotherapy. This approach is similar to the Control Treatment in that it involves a combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, but with a reduced toxicity profile tailored to the patient's age and comorbidities.\n\nTREATMENT 1 and TREATMENT 3 both involve the use of ABVD chemotherapy, but TREATMENT 1 also includes the use of radiotherapy in all patients, while TREATMENT 3 includes radiotherapy only if the patient has a positive PET scan after 2 cycles of chemotherapy. These approaches are less similar to the Control Treatment, which involves the use of immunotherapy drugs in combination with each other, rather than with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy."

    "TREATMENT 1 has the most relevant supporting text to the Control Treatment. This is because it discusses the use of carboplatin in patients with chronic kidney disease, which is the reason for the chosen treatment in the Control Treatment. Additionally, it mentions the use of gemcitabine in combination with carboplatin, which is the Control Treatment. The other treatments do not mention carboplatin or its use in patients with chronic kidney disease.",
    "TREATMENT 1 contains the most relevant supporting text to the Control Treatment. This is because it describes the use of chemoradiation with doublet chemotherapy, which is the same as the control treatment. It also mentions the use of cisplatin and 5-FU, which are the specific chemotherapy agents used in the control treatment. While TREATMENT 3 also describes the use of chemoradiation, it does not specify the use of doublet chemotherapy or the specific agents used. TREATMENT 2 does not describe the use of chemoradiation at all.",
    "TREATMENT 1 does not contain the most relevant supporting text to the Control Treatment. It discusses the results of a clinical trial on positron emission tomography response-adapted treatment in stage I and II Hodgkin lymphoma, but it does not mention salvage chemotherapy or autologous stem cell transplant.\n\nTREATMENT 2 contains more relevant supporting text to the Control Treatment. It discusses the use of ABVD followed by radiation therapy (RT) versus ABVD alone for stages I, II, and IIIA nonbulky hodgkin disease. This is similar to the Control Treatment, which mentions initiating salvage chemotherapy with ifosfamide/carboplatin/etoposide (ICE) and planning for autologous stem cell transplant (autoSCT) for standard initial treatment for relapsed cHL.\n\nTREATMENT 3 does not contain the most relevant supporting text to the Control Treatment. It discusses the use of interim PET to reduce toxicity without losing efficacy of treatment in advanced-stage HL, but it does not mention salvage chemotherapy or autologous stem cell transplant.\n\nTherefore, TREATMENT 2 is the most like the Control Treatment.",
    "TREATMENT 1 does not contain any relevant supporting text to the Control Treatment. It discusses various chemotherapy regimens and trials for Hodgkin lymphoma, but it does not mention the combination of brentuximab vedotin and nivolumab.\n\nTREATMENT 2 contains relevant supporting text to the Control Treatment. It mentions a trial that compared treatment with brentuximab vedotin and nivolumab to other treatments for Hodgkin lymphoma.\n\nTREATMENT 3 does not contain any relevant supporting text to the Control Treatment. It discusses various trials and treatments for Hodgkin lymphoma, but it does not mention the combination of brentuximab vedotin and nivolumab.\n\nTherefore, TREATMENT 2 contains the most relevant supporting text to the Control Treatment."
