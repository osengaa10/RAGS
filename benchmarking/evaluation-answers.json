    "Based on the information provided, TREATMENT 3 is the most similar to the Control Treatment. The Control Treatment involves the use of carboplatin plus gemcitabine due to the patient's chronic kidney disease and FGFR2 mutation. TREATMENT 3 also involves the use of an FGFR inhibitor, erdafitinib, due to the patient's FGFR2 mutation. However, the Control Treatment mentions that erdafitinib would not be used for front-line therapy, while TREATMENT 3 suggests that it may be appropriate as first-line treatment. TREATMENT 1 and TREATMENT 2 are not similar to the Control Treatment as TREATMENT 1 recommends the use of erdafitinib as first-line treatment despite the patient's chronic kidney disease, and TREATMENT 2 recommends the use of VEGF-targeted drugs, which are not mentioned in the Control Treatment.",
    "Based on the information provided, TREATMENT 1 and TREATMENT 2 are the most similar to the Control Treatment. Both of these treatments involve maximal safe TURBT followed by concurrent chemoradiation therapy, which is consistent with the Control Treatment. The main difference between these treatments and the Control Treatment is the chemotherapy regimen used. In TREATMENT 1 and TREATMENT 2, the chemotherapy regimen is individualized based on the patient's renal function, performance status, and other factors, while in the Control Treatment, the chemotherapy regimen is specifically cisplatin and 5-FU. TREATMENT 3, on the other hand, involves neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy and concurrent chemotherapy, which is not consistent with the Control Treatment.",
    "Based on the information provided, TREATMENT 1 is the most similar to the Control Treatment. The Control Treatment recommends initiating salvage chemotherapy with the ICE regimen and planning for autologous stem cell transplant (autoSCT), which is the same as the recommendation in TREATMENT 1. TREATMENT 2 and TREATMENT 3 also recommend salvage chemotherapy followed by autoSCT, but they do not specify a particular chemotherapy regimen. Additionally, TREATMENT 2 and TREATMENT 3 mention the possibility of using other salvage chemotherapy regimens, such as DHAP or GDP, which are not mentioned in the Control Treatment. Therefore, TREATMENT 1 is the most similar to the Control Treatment.",
    "Based on the provided information, TREATMENT 3 is the most similar to the Control Treatment. Both the Control Treatment and TREATMENT 3 involve a combination of chemotherapy (ABVD) and involved-field radiotherapy (IFRT) for the treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma. However, the Control Treatment uses a combination of brentuximab vedotin and nivolumab, while TREATMENT 3 uses ABVD. The reason for the similarity is that both treatments take into account the patient's age, ECOG performance status, and history of comorbidities, and aim to provide a less toxic treatment regimen while ensuring quality of life.",
    "Based on the provided context, TREATMENT 2 is closest to the Control Treatment. The Control Treatment involves TURBT followed by a single dose of intravesical mitomycin. TREATMENT 2 also includes TURBT and a single instillation of intravesical chemotherapy (mitomycin C or epirubicin) within 24 hours of TURBT. This aligns with the Control Treatment's approach of using a single dose of intravesical chemotherapy after TURBT.\n\nTREATMENT 1 recommends intravesical BCG therapy, which is different from the single dose of intravesical chemotherapy recommended in the Control Treatment. TREATMENT 3 recommends one immediate instillation of chemotherapy followed by further instillations, which goes beyond the single dose recommended in the Control Treatment.\n\nTherefore, TREATMENT 2 is the most similar to the Control Treatment.",
    "Based on the provided information, TREATMENT 1 is the most similar to the Control Treatment. The Control Treatment involves maintenance immunotherapy with avelumab following a response to platinum-based chemotherapy. TREATMENT 1 also involves maintenance therapy, but with gemcitabine instead of avelumab, following a response to platinum-based chemotherapy. Both treatments individualize the duration based on the patient's response, tolerability, and preferences. TREATMENT 2 and TREATMENT 3 do not involve maintenance therapy and instead focus on continuing the initial treatment regimen or switching to a different regimen after a response to the initial treatment.",
    "Based on the provided information, TREATMENT 1 is the most similar to the Control Treatment. The Control Treatment recommends repeating staging with TURBT and considering further treatment based on the presence or absence of invasion into the muscularis propria. TREATMENT 1 also recommends a repeat TURBT for staging and confirmation of tumor depth, and considers additional treatments based on the depth of invasion.\n\nTREATMENT 2 and TREATMENT 3 both provide additional treatment options beyond TURBT and staging, such as intravesical therapy and radical cystectomy, which are not mentioned in the Control Treatment.\n\nTherefore, TREATMENT 1 is the most similar to the Control Treatment as it focuses on repeating staging with TURBT and considering further treatment based on the results.",
    "Based on the provided information, TREATMENT 1 and TREATMENT 2 are the most similar to the Control Treatment. Both of these treatments recommend using the BEP chemotherapy regimen (bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin) for three to four cycles, which is consistent with the Control Treatment. TREATMENT 3, on the other hand, recommends a different chemotherapy regimen (vincristine, actinomycin D, and cyclophosphamide) which is not mentioned in the Control Treatment.\n\nAdditionally, both TREATMENT 1 and TREATMENT 2 mention the importance of monitoring the AFP level during and after chemotherapy, which is also consistent with the Control Treatment. TREATMENT 3 does not mention monitoring the AFP level, which is a disadvantage compared to TREATMENT 1 and TREATMENT 2.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided information, TREATMENT 1 and TREATMENT 2 are the most similar to the Control Treatment.",
    "Based on the provided information, TREATMENT 1, TREATMENT 2, and TREATMENT 3 all recommend the use of a PARP inhibitor, specifically olaparib, niraparib, or rucaparib, as maintenance therapy for a patient with a deleterious BRCA1 mutation and high-grade serous adenocarcinoma of the ovary who has just completed carboplatin and paclitaxel for her first platinum-sensitive recurrence. The recommended PARP inhibitor therapy is consistent with the Control Treatment, which states that maintenance therapy with a PARP inhibitor is now indicated for all patients following completion of a platinum-based regimen for their first platinum-sensitive recurrence, particularly for women with BRCA mutations or HRD.\n\nTherefore, all three treatments are similar to the Control Treatment, but it is not possible to definitively determine which treatment is the closest match without additional information. Factors such as the specific patient's clinical situation, potential side effects, and the optimal duration of PARP inhibitor therapy may influence which treatment is most appropriate.",
    "Based on the information provided, TREATMENT 3 is the most like the Control Treatment. Both the Control Treatment and TREATMENT 3 recommend continuing treatment with AVD for a total of 6 cycles and omitting bleomycin during cycles 3 to 6. TREATMENT 1 and TREATMENT 2 recommend different treatment regimens that are not consistent with the Control Treatment.",
    "Based on the information provided, TREATMENT 2 is the most similar to the Control Treatment. Like the Control Treatment, TREATMENT 2 recommends additional systemic therapy for a patient with recurrent endometrial cancer and known Lynch syndrome with MSH2 gene mutation. While the Control Treatment recommends pembrolizumab, TREATMENT 2 suggests a combination of carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab as an option for further treatment. This is still a systemic therapy approach, which aligns with the Control Treatment. TREATMENT 1 and TREATMENT 3 suggest different approaches, such as multi-agent chemotherapy and hormonal therapy or targeted agents, respectively, which are not as similar to the Control Treatment.",
    "Based on the information provided, TREATMENT 1 is the most similar to the Control Treatment. Both the Control Treatment and TREATMENT 1 recommend primary radiation therapy for the treatment of endometrial cancer that is confined to the uterus. This approach is considered effective and safer than surgery for this patient due to her comorbidities. TREATMENT 2 and TREATMENT 3, on the other hand, recommend endocrine therapy and hormonal therapy, respectively, as alternatives to cytotoxic chemotherapy or surgery. While these treatments may be appropriate for certain patients, they are not as similar to the Control Treatment as TREATMENT 1.",
    "Based on the information provided, TREATMENT 1 is the most similar to the Control Treatment. This is because TREATMENT 1 not only identifies the most likely primary site as the colon based on the immunohistochemistry profile, but also provides a detailed treatment regimen that is consistent with standard care for colorectal cancer. This includes systemic chemotherapy with a FOLFOX or CapeOx regimen, consideration of adding bevacizumab, reassessment with a CT scan after 6 cycles of chemotherapy, and continued surveillance with CT scans and CEA levels. TREATMENT 2 and TREATMENT 3 also correctly identify the most likely primary site as the colon based on the immunohistochemistry profile, but they do not provide a detailed treatment regimen.",
    "Based on the information provided, TREATMENT 1 is the most similar to the Control Treatment. Both the Control Treatment and TREATMENT 1 recommend the use of pembrolizumab as the first-line treatment option for this patient with dMMR/MSI-H tumors. TREATMENT 1 provides more specific details about the patient's tumor and the rationale for using pembrolizumab, but the recommended treatment is the same as the Control Treatment.\n\nTREATMENT 2 also recommends the use of a PD-1 inhibitor, such as pembrolizumab or nivolumab, but it suggests testing for PD-L1 expression and considers the use of modified DCF in combination with growth factor support. TREATMENT 3 recommends the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as pembrolizumab, but it does not provide as much detail about the patient's tumor or the rationale for using immune checkpoint inhibitors.\n\nTherefore, TREATMENT 1 is the most similar to the Control Treatment.",
    "Based on the information provided, TREATMENT 2 is the most similar to the Control Treatment. The reasoning for this is that TREATMENT 2 specifically mentions chronic GVHD affecting the eyes, mouth, and musculoskeletal system, which aligns with the symptoms described in the Control Treatment. Additionally, TREATMENT 2 mentions the patient's history of acute GVHD and current use of tacrolimus for GVHD prophylaxis, which are also mentioned in the Control Treatment. The proposed treatment plan in TREATMENT 2 is also consistent with the Control Treatment, emphasizing the continuation of immunosuppressive therapy and the addition of steroids to manage symptoms.\n\nTREATMENT 1 is similar to the Control Treatment in that it also suggests chronic GVHD as the most likely diagnosis, but it does not specify the affected systems as TREATMENT 2 does. TREATMENT 3 is also similar to the Control Treatment, but it does not mention the patient's history of acute GVHD or her current use of tacrolimus for GVHD prophylaxis.\n\nIn summary, TREATMENT 2 is the most similar to the Control Treatment due to its specific mention of the affected systems, the patient's history of acute GVHD, and the current use of tacrolimus for GVHD prophylaxis.",
    "Based on the information provided, TREATMENT 2 is the most similar to the Control Treatment. Both the Control Treatment and TREATMENT 2 involve continuing ibrutinib therapy for a patient with CLL and del(17p) mutation. The increase in WBC and ALC counts observed in TREATMENT 2 is expected in CLL patients treated with ibrutinib and does not necessarily indicate disease progression or treatment failure. Therefore, the recommended approach in both cases is to continue the ibrutinib therapy and closely monitor the patient's laboratory results and clinical symptoms.",
    "Based on the provided context and the details of each treatment plan, all three treatment options (Treatment 1, 2, and 3) are identical to the Control Treatment. They all recommend Ibrutinib as the most appropriate frontline therapy for the patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), worsening symptoms, significant cytopenias, and deletion 17p. The recommended dosage and monitoring are also consistent across all options. Therefore, all three treatments are equally closest to the Control Treatment.",
    "Based on the information provided, TREATMENT 1 is the most similar to the Control Treatment. Both the Control Treatment and TREATMENT 1 mention the patient's heritage, peripheral blood features, and the association with HTLV-1 infection, which are all crucial factors in diagnosing Adult T-cell Leukemia/Lymphoma (ATLL). TREATMENT 2 also mentions these factors but does not explicitly mention the patient's heritage, making it less specific than the Control Treatment and TREATMENT 1. TREATMENT 3 describes a different subtype of peripheral T-cell lymphoma (ENKTL), which is associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, not HTLV-1 infection, making it significantly different from the Control Treatment.",
    "Based on the information provided, TREATMENT 2 is the most similar to the Control Treatment. Both the Control Treatment and TREATMENT 2 recommend considering a biopsy of the residual mass to ensure persistent disease. TREATMENT 2 also recommends consolidative radiotherapy (RT) to the residual mass, which is a reasonable next step for residual masses greater than 1.5 cm after chemotherapy in PMBCL, as supported by several retrospective studies. This is in line with the Control Treatment's recommendation to confirm the presence of disease with a biopsy prior to additional therapy.\n\nTREATMENT 1, on the other hand, recommends monitoring the residual mass with imaging, which is not mentioned in the Control Treatment. TREATMENT 3 mentions the possibility of additional therapy, such as radiation therapy or consolidation with high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation, but does not specifically recommend a biopsy of the residual mass.\n\nTherefore, TREATMENT 2 is the most similar to the Control Treatment.",
    "Based on the information provided, TREATMENT 1 is closest to the Control Treatment. Both the Control Treatment and TREATMENT 1 recommend antiviral prophylaxis with Entecavir during and for 12 months after rituximab therapy in patients with a history of hepatitis B infection. TREATMENT 2 and TREATMENT 3 do not specify the duration of antiviral prophylaxis and only mention monitoring HBV serology and DNA during and after rituximab therapy. Additionally, TREATMENT 1 provides more detailed recommendations for monitoring HBV viral load, liver function tests, and signs and symptoms of HBV reactivation, which aligns more closely with the Control Treatment.",
    "Based on the provided information, TREATMENT 2 is the most similar to the Control Treatment. Both the Control Treatment and TREATMENT 2 involve the use of FISH analysis to determine the presence of MYC rearrangement, and both discuss the possibility of high-grade B-cell lymphoma with MYC and BCL2 rearrangements (double-hit lymphoma). TREATMENT 2 also includes additional testing and considerations that are relevant to the management of this type of lymphoma, such as bone marrow biopsy, PET-CT scan, and molecular studies.\n\nTREATMENT 1 does not include FISH analysis for MYC rearrangement, which is a critical component of the Control Treatment. TREATMENT 3 includes FISH analysis for MYC rearrangement, but it also includes a number of additional tests and considerations that are not included in the Control Treatment, such as molecular studies for MYD88 L265P mutation, blood tests for monoclonal IgM protein, and assessment of cardiac ejection fraction and serum electrolytes.\n\nTherefore, TREATMENT 2 is the most similar to the Control Treatment.",
    "Based on the information provided, TREATMENT 1 is the most similar to the Control Treatment. The Control Treatment involves the use of combination immunotherapy with ipilimumab/nivolumab, which is an effective frontline therapy for metastatic RCC of clear cell type. TREATMENT 1 also recommends systemic therapy for metastatic RCC with clear cell histology, and mentions the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as nivolumab and ipilimumab, in combination with VEGF-targeted therapies.\n\nTREATMENT 2 and TREATMENT 3 do not mention the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors, and instead focus on the use of VEGF-targeted therapies such as sorafenib, sunitinib, and pazopanib. While these treatments can be effective for metastatic RCC, they are not as similar to the Control Treatment as TREATMENT 1.\n\nIt's important to note that the choice of treatment regimen for metastatic RCC depends on various factors, including patient performance status, risk group, and molecular characteristics of the tumor. The International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium (IMDC) risk model can be used to stratify patients into favorable, intermediate, and poor-risk groups based on clinical and laboratory parameters. The patient's history of coronary artery disease and hypertension should also be taken into account when selecting a treatment regimen.",
    "Based on the information provided, TREATMENT 1 is the most similar to the Control Treatment. Both the Control Treatment and TREATMENT 1 mention the patient's Birt-Hogg-Dubé (BHD) syndrome, which is caused by a mutation in the FLCN gene. They both also discuss the patient's increased risk of renal cancer, particularly chromophobe and hybrid oncocytic tumors, as well as the patient's history of spontaneous pneumothoraces and family history of lung-related issues.\n\nTREATMENT 2 and TREATMENT 3 also mention BHD syndrome and the FLCN gene mutation, but they do not provide as much detail as TREATMENT 1 and the Control Treatment. TREATMENT 2 focuses on the folliculin gene mutation in sporadic chromophobe RCC tumors, which is not mentioned in the Control Treatment. TREATMENT 3 mentions the presence of benign tumors and malignant tumors within the same kidney, which is not mentioned in the Control Treatment.\n\nTherefore, TREATMENT 1 is the most similar to the Control Treatment.",
    "Based on the information provided, TREATMENT 3 is the most similar to the Control Treatment. The Control Treatment involves switching to first-line chemotherapy with docetaxel, which is also an option presented in TREATMENT 3. The patient's castration-resistant metastatic prostate cancer with new liver metastases and rising PSA despite being on continuous leuprolide, zoledronic acid, and abiraterone + prednisone makes him a candidate for docetaxel chemotherapy. The other treatment options presented in TREATMENT 1 and TREATMENT 2 are not mentioned in the Control Treatment and involve different treatment approaches.",
    "Based on the information provided, TREATMENT 2 is the most similar to the Control Treatment. Both the Control Treatment and TREATMENT 2 involve the use of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and chemotherapy (docetaxel) for a patient with metastatic prostate cancer. TREATMENT 2 also includes additional recommendations for bisphosphonate therapy, palliative radiation therapy, and close monitoring, which are all consistent with best practices in the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer.\n\nTREATMENT 1 is not as similar to the Control Treatment because it does not explicitly recommend the use of chemotherapy, although it does mention the possibility of adding docetaxel. TREATMENT 3 is also less similar to the Control Treatment because it suggests the possibility of using radiation therapy instead of chemotherapy, which is not recommended in the Control Treatment for a patient with high-volume disease.\n\nTherefore, TREATMENT 2 is the closest to the Control Treatment.",
    "Based on the information provided, TREATMENT 1: is the closest to the Control Treatment. The Control Treatment recommends Radium-223 for this patient, and TREATMENT 1: also suggests Radium-223 as an appropriate option for this patient with bone-only castration-resistant disease. The other treatments (TREATMENT 2: and TREATMENT 3:) propose different treatment options, such as denosumab, docetaxel, cabazitaxel, enzalutamide, apalutamide, and sipuleucel-T, which are not mentioned in the Control Treatment."
