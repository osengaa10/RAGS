        "answer": "The appropriate first-line treatment for this patient with metastatic bladder cancer, a history of hypertension and chronic kidney disease, a PD-L1 score of <1%, and a FGFR2 mutation would be erdafitinib. Erdafitinib is a fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) inhibitor that was approved by the FDA in 2019 for the treatment of adults with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma, with FGFR2 or FGFR3 mutations or fusions, who have progressed during or following at least one line of prior platinum-containing chemotherapy. The recommended dose of erdafitinib is 8 mg orally once daily with food on a continuous schedule. The dose should be increased to 9 mg once daily with food after 21 days if no dose-limiting toxicities are observed. The dose should be further increased to 10 mg once daily with food after 21 days if no dose-limiting toxicities are observed. The dose should be reduced for adverse reactions.\n\nIt is important to note that the patient's renal function should be closely monitored while on erdafitinib, as it can cause renal toxicity. The patient's blood pressure should also be closely monitored and managed as hypertension is a common side effect of erdafitinib.\n\nIt is also important to note that immune checkpoint inhibitors such as pembrolizumab, nivolumab, and atezolizumab are not recommended as first-line treatment for this patient as her PD-L1 score is <1%. These drugs have been proven to be superior to standard chemotherapy in the second line and should be considered a preferred option in this setting.\n\nIt is also important to note that cisplatin-based chemotherapy is associated with a survival benefit in metastatic urothelial cancer. However, it is estimated that up to 50% of patients will be ineligible for cisplatin-based therapy because of impaired renal function, poor performance status, or other medical illnesses. Carboplatin-based regimens are commonly used in the community and recommended in clinical practice guidelines but are inferior to cisplatin.\n\nIt is also important to note that the patient's nephron-sparing surgery has become the gold standard, when feasible. Follow-up guidelines for resected RCC include history, physical examination, periodic metabolic panels, and abdominal and chest computed tomography (CT) studies 4 to 6 months after surgery.\n\nIt is also important to note that many additional studies evaluating immune checkpoint inhibitors alone, immune checkpoint inhibitors in combination with chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and dual checkpoint inhibitors in patients with different clinical stages of urothelial cancer are underway.\n\nIn summary, the appropriate first-line treatment for this patient with metastatic bladder cancer, a history of hypertension and chronic kidney disease, a PD-L1 score of <1%, and a FGFR2 mutation would be erdafitinib. The recommended dose of erdafitinib is 8 mg orally once daily with food on a continuous schedule.

        "answer": "Based on the information provided, the optimal management for this patient with muscle-invasive (T2) bladder cancer and no comorbidities who wishes to avoid a urostomy would be trimodality bladder preservation therapy. This approach involves maximal safe TURBT followed by concurrent chemoradiation therapy.\n\nHere is a detailed treatment regimen:\n\n1. Maximal safe TURBT: The tumor should be completely resected, taking care to avoid bladder perforation.\n2. Staging evaluation: Chest, abdominal, and pelvic imaging should be performed to assess for metastatic disease. A bone scan may be considered if there are concerns for bony metastasis.\n3. Concurrent chemoradiation therapy: The patient should undergo radiation therapy with a total dose of 64 to 65 Gy, delivered in fractions of 1.8 to 2 Gy, concurrently with chemotherapy. The most commonly used chemotherapy regimen is cisplatin, but other options include gemcitabine, 5-FU, and mitomycin C. The choice of chemotherapy regimen should be individualized based on the patient's kidney function, performance status, and other factors.\n4. Follow-up: After completion of treatment, the patient should undergo regular cystoscopies and imaging studies to monitor for recurrence. The optimal surveillance regimen remains unknown, but frequent surveillance is warranted for this patient given his high risk of recurrence.\n\nIt is important to note that trimodality bladder preservation therapy is not suitable for all patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer. Patients with extensive carcinoma in situ (CIS) or hydronephrosis may not be good candidates for this approach. In such cases, radical cystectomy with neoadjuvant chemotherapy may be a better option.

        "answer": "Given the patient's age, ECOG performance status of 2, and history of comorbidities including hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease, a treatment regimen with reduced toxicity would be most appropriate.\n\nOne reasonable treatment recommendation would be 2 cycles of ABVD (doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine) chemotherapy followed by 20 Gy of involved-field radiotherapy (IFRT). This approach has been shown to be sufficient and less toxic in the treatment of early-stage favorable risk Hodgkin lymphoma, and it is now the standard of care within the German Hodgkin Study Group (GHSG) and an increasing number of centers worldwide.\n\nIt is important to note that patients with HIV are not candidates for the escBEACOPP regimen, and efforts have been made to develop distinct approaches for NLPHL due to the distinct clinical presentation and natural history of this subtype of HL.\n\nClose monitoring of the patient's comorbidities, particularly his coronary artery disease, will be necessary throughout the treatment course to ensure his safety and quality of life.",

As previously discussed, it represents a unique pathobiological entity with a distinct clinical presentation and natural history. Historically, treatment of LP HL paralleled that of \ncHL, with most patients treated using extended- or regional-field RT, \nwith or without chemotherapy. The majority of deaths in patients treated for NLPHL were related to late effects, primarily cardiovascular disease and second malignancies.\n78 Deaths from disease were rare. \nBased on these findings, efforts to develop distinct approaches for NLPHL have emerged. Small patient numbers and very favorable outcomes preclude randomized trials in this subtype of HL."
