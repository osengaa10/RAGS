Erdafitinib is a fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) inhibitor that was approved by the FDA in 2019 for the treatment of adults with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma, with FGFR2 or FGFR3 mutations or fusions, who have progressed during or following at least one line of prior platinum-containing chemotherapy. The recommended dose of erdafitinib is 8 mg orally once daily with food on a continuous schedule. The dose should be increased to 9 mg once daily with food after 21 days if no dose-limiting toxicities are observed. The dose should be further increased to 10 mg once daily with food after 21 days if no dose-limiting toxicities are observed. The dose should be reduced for adverse reactions. The patient's renal function and blood pressure should be closely monitored during treatment with erdafitinib.\n\nIt is important to note that the patient's chronic kidney disease and hypertension may increase the risk of adverse reactions to erdafitinib. The patient should be closely monitored for adverse reactions and the dose of erdafitinib should be reduced as necessary. Additionally, the patient's renal function and blood pressure should be closely monitored during treatment with erdafitinib.\n\nIt is also important to note that the patient's PD-L1 score is <1%, which suggests that she may not respond to immune checkpoint inhibitors such as pembrolizumab. Therefore, erdafitinib would be a more appropriate first-line treatment option for this patient.\n\nIn summary, the appropriate first-line treatment for this patient with metastatic bladder cancer, a history of hypertension and chronic kidney disease, a PD-L1 score of <1%, and a FGFR2 mutation would be erdafitinib at a dose of 8 mg orally once daily with food on a continuous schedule.

        "answer": "Based on the information provided, the optimal management for this patient with muscle-invasive (T2) bladder cancer and no comorbidities who wishes to avoid a urostomy would be trimodality bladder preservation therapy. This approach involves maximal safe TURBT followed by concurrent chemoradiation therapy.\n\nHere is a detailed treatment regimen:\n\n1. Maximal safe TURBT: The tumor should be completely resected, taking care to avoid bladder perforation.\n2. Staging evaluation: Chest, abdominal, and pelvic imaging should be performed to assess for metastatic disease. A bone scan may be considered if there are concerns for bony metastasis.\n3. Concurrent chemoradiation therapy: The patient should undergo radiation therapy with a total dose of 64 to 65 Gy, delivered in fractions of 1.8 to 2 Gy, concurrently with chemotherapy. The most commonly used chemotherapy regimen is cisplatin, but other options include gemcitabine, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), and mitomycin C. The choice of chemotherapy regimen should be individualized based on the patient's kidney function, performance status, and other factors.\n4. Follow-up: After completing treatment, the patient should undergo regular cystoscopies and imaging studies to monitor for recurrence. The optimal surveillance regimen remains unknown, but frequent surveillance is warranted for this patient given his high risk of recurrence.\n\nIt is important to note that trimodality bladder preservation therapy is not suitable for all patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer. Patients with extensive carcinoma in situ (CIS), hydronephrosis, or other high-risk features may be better candidates for radical cystectomy.

        "answer": "The most appropriate next step in management for this patient with relapsed stage IV cHL after completion of ABVD therapy would be to consider salvage chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) in eligible patients.\n\nOne option for salvage chemotherapy is the DHAP regimen, which consists of cisplatin, high-dose cytarabine, and dexamethasone. This regimen has been shown to be effective in the treatment of relapsed or refractory HL (Velasquez et al., 1988). Another option is the ICE regimen, which consists of ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide. This regimen has also been shown to be effective in the treatment of relapsed or refractory HL (Sirohi et al., 2005).\n\nAfter salvage chemotherapy, ASCT is recommended for eligible patients. This approach has been shown to improve progression-free survival and overall survival in patients with relapsed or refractory HL (S Snowden et al., 2000; Schmitz et al., 2012).\n\nIt is important to note that the patient's eligibility for ASCT will depend on various factors, including age, performance status, and organ function. If the patient is not a candidate for ASCT, other treatment options, such as clinical trials or palliative care, should be considered.\n\nIn addition, the patient's response to salvage chemotherapy should be evaluated with PET/CT. If the patient achieves a complete metabolic response, maintenance therapy with an inhibitor of phosphoinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) may be considered (Gisselbrecht et al., 2016).\n\nReferences:\n\nGordon LI, Hong F, Fisher RI, et al.

This approach has been shown to be sufficient and less toxic in the treatment of early-stage favorable risk Hodgkin lymphoma, and it is now the standard of care within the German Hodgkin Study Group (GHSG) and an increasing number of centers worldwide.\n\nIt is important to note that patients with HIV are not candidates for the escBEACOPP regimen, and efforts have been made to develop distinct approaches for NLPHL due to the distinct clinical presentation and natural history of this subtype of HL.\n\nClose monitoring of the patient's comorbidities, particularly his coronary artery disease, will be necessary throughout the treatment course to ensure his safety and quality of life.",

Historically, treatment of LP HL paralleled that of \ncHL, with most patients treated using extended- or regional-field RT, \nwith or without chemotherapy. The majority of deaths in patients treated for NLPHL were related to late effects, primarily cardiovascular disease and second malignancies.\n78 Deaths from disease were rare. \nBased on these findings, efforts to develop distinct approaches for NLPHL have emerged.
