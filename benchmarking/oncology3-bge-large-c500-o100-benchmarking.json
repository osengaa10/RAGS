One commonly used salvage regimen is ICE (ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide), which has shown efficacy in relapsed/refractory HL. Other options include DHAP (dexamethasone, cytarabine, and cisplatin) or GDP (gemcitabine, dexamethasone, and cisplatin).\n\nAfter achieving a response to salvage chemotherapy, the patient should undergo ASCT.

        "answer": "Given the patient's age, stage of disease, performance status, and comorbidities, the most reasonable treatment recommendation would be a regimen with reduced toxicity. A clinical trial of PET-guided radiotherapy in patients with advanced stage Hodgkin lymphoma (The Lancet 2012; 379: 1791–1799) found that a regimen of ABVD (doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine) chemotherapy followed by involved-site radiotherapy in patients with a positive PET scan after 2 cycles of chemotherapy resulted in a 3-year progression-free survival rate of 80.7%.\n\nHowever, in this case, due to the patient's age and comorbidities, it would be reasonable to consider omitting bleomycin from the ABVD regimen, given the risk of pulmonary toxicity in older patients treated with front-line ABVD chemotherapy (Br J Haematol . 2015;170(2):179–184). This modified regimen, often referred to as AVD, has been shown to have similar efficacy to ABVD with less pulmonary toxicity (J Clin Oncol . 2015;33(31):3630-3636).\n\nAdditionally, due to the patient's frailty and comorbidities, it may be necessary to reduce the dosage of chemotherapy or administer it on a reduced schedule. Close monitoring of the patient's clinical status and toxicity will be necessary throughout treatment.\n\nIn terms of specifics, the patient can be started on AVD chemotherapy, with doxorubicin 25mg/m2, vinblastine 6mg/m2, and dacarbazine 375mg/m2, on days 1 and 15 of a 28-day cycle, for a total of 6 cycles. The patient's response to treatment should be assessed with PET scans after 2 and 4 cycles. If the patient has a positive PET scan after 2 cycles, involved-site radiotherapy should be considered.\n\nIt is important to note that the patient's comorbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease, should be closely managed throughout treatment, and any necessary adjustments to the treatment regimen should be made in consultation with the patient's primary care physician and/or cardiologist.",
