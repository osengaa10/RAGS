        "answer": "The most appropriate next step in management for this patient with relapsed stage IV cHL would be to consider salvage chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT). Given the patient's young age and good performance status, they are likely to be a candidate for ASCT.\n\nOne option for salvage chemotherapy is the ICE regimen (ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide), which has shown efficacy in relapsed/refractory HL. Other options include the DHAP regimen (dexamethasone, cytarabine, and cisplatin) or the GDP regimen (gemcitabine, dexamethasone, and cisplatin). The choice of salvage regimen may depend on the patient's previous treatment history and any toxicities they experienced.\n\nAfter achieving a response to salvage chemotherapy, the patient would then undergo ASCT. This involves collecting and storing the patient's own stem cells, administering high-dose chemotherapy to eliminate residual disease, and then reinfusing the stored stem cells to promote hematopoietic recovery.\n\nIt's important to note that the patient's PET/CT shows diffuse disease, which suggests a more aggressive relapse. In this case, the patient may benefit from the addition of brentuximab vedotin, an anti-CD30 monoclonal antibody, to their salvage regimen. Brentuximab vedotin has shown efficacy in relapsed/refractory HL and can be used in combination with chemotherapy or as a single agent.\n\nOverall, the management of relapsed cHL requires a multidisciplinary approach and should be tailored to the individual patient's needs and treatment history.

A clinical trial of PET-guided radiotherapy in patients with advanced stage Hodgkin lymphoma (The Lancet 2012; 379: 1791–1799) found that a regimen of ABVD (doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine) chemotherapy followed by involved-site radiotherapy in patients with a positive PET scan after 2 cycles of chemotherapy resulted in a 3-year progression-free survival rate of 80.7%.\n\nHowever, in this case, due to the patient's age and comorbidities, it would be advisable to consider omitting bleomycin from the ABVD regimen, given the risk of pulmonary toxicity in older patients. A study of front line ABVD chemotherapy in patients older than 60 years with classical Hodgkin lymphoma (Br J Haematol . 2015;170(2):179–184) found that frequent pulmonary events suggest limiting the use of bleomycin in the elderly.\n\nTherefore, a reasonable treatment recommendation for this patient would be a regimen of AVDC (doxorubicin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine) chemotherapy, followed by involved-site radiotherapy in patients with a positive PET scan after 2 cycles of chemotherapy.

Given the ovarian capsule rupture, which increases the risk of dissemination, chemotherapy is particularly important in this case.\n\nThe postoperative alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level is a useful tumor marker for monitoring response to treatment and for detecting recurrence. AFP levels should be monitored closely during and after chemotherapy.\n\nIt is also important to note that the patient's age is a favorable prognostic factor, as yolk sac tumors in young patients tend to have a better prognosis.\n\nIn summary, the best next step in treatment is to start systemic chemotherapy with BEP for 3-4 cycles, and to closely monitor AFP levels during and after chemotherapy.",

These agents have shown significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with platinum-sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer and a deleterious BRCA mutation.\n\nFor example, in the study by Ledermann et al.

Therefore, it is important to continue with the planned treatment to achieve the best possible outcome for the patient.\n\nIn the case of early-stage nonbulky cHL, three to four cycles of ABVD alone have been shown to result in equivalent overall survival and less long-term toxicity compared to combined-modality therapy with ABVD and involved-field radiotherapy (IFRT). However, in this case, the patient has stage IIIA cHL, which is considered advanced-stage disease. For advanced-stage cHL, the standard of care is to use combined-modality therapy with ABVD and IFRT.\n\nIt is also worth noting that recent clinical trials have investigated the use of interim PET to tailor therapy in both early and advanced HL. The RAPID trial, for example, found that PET-directed therapy can improve progression-free survival in patients with early-stage HL.

        "answer": "Based on the immunohistochemical staining results, the patient's tumor is deficient in the mismatch repair proteins PMS2 and MLH1, and proficient in MSH2 and MSH6. This pattern of staining is consistent with Lynch syndrome, which is caused by germline mutations in the mismatch repair genes, including MLH1 and MSH2. However, in this case, the patient is 68 years old, which is more typical of sporadic colorectal cancer (CRC). Sporadic CRC with mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR) and high microsatellite instability (MSI-H) has been shown to have a high response rate to immune checkpoint inhibitors, particularly PD-1 inhibitors.\n\nTherefore, I would recommend considering the use of a PD-1 inhibitor, such as pembrolizumab or nivolumab, as a systemic therapy option for this patient. These agents have been shown to have response rates of up to 50-60% in dMMR/MSI-H CRC. It is important to note that the patient's tumor should be tested for PD-L1 expression, as this has been shown to be a predictive biomarker for response to PD-1 inhibitors in dMMR/MSI-H CRC.\n\nAnother option for systemic therapy in this patient is the use of modified docetaxel, cisplatin, and fluorouracil (DCF) in combination with growth factor support. This regimen has been shown to have a response rate of 55% in metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma. However, it is important to note that this regimen is associated with significant toxicity and should be considered carefully in older patients.\n\nIn summary, I would recommend considering the use of a PD-1 inhibitor, such as pembrolizumab or nivolumab, as the systemic therapy option with the highest response rate in this patient.

The limited range of motion in her arms and mild weight loss are also consistent with this diagnosis.

Primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL) is a distinct clinicopathologic entity that typically presents as a large mediastinal mass in young patients. While chemotherapy alone can result in high response rates, residual masses are common and can represent active disease.\n\nThe National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines recommend consolidative RT for residual masses greater than 1.5 cm after chemotherapy in PMBCL. This recommendation is based on several retrospective studies that have demonstrated improved progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) with the addition of RT.\n\nIn this case, the patient received six cycles of DA-EPOCH-P, a toxicity-adjusted, infusional regimen plus rituximab, and had a residual mass on PET/CT completed 4 weeks after therapy. Given the size of the residual mass, consolidative RT would be a reasonable next step. The radiation oncologist would determine the appropriate dose and field based on the size and location of the residual mass.\n\nIt is important to note that the long-term effects of RT, including cardiac toxicity and secondary malignancies, should be considered when making treatment decisions.

The Ki67 proliferation index is 95%. These findings are suggestive of a high-grade B-cell lymphoma with MYC and BCL2 rearrangements, also known as double-hit lymphoma (DHL).\n\nTo confirm the diagnosis, the following tests should be performed:\n\n1. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis: This test is used to detect gene rearrangements, particularly MYC, BCL2, and BCL6. The presence of both MYC and BCL2 rearrangements will confirm the diagnosis of DHL.\n2. Bone marrow biopsy: Given the patient's high LDH level and constitutional symptoms, a bone marrow biopsy is necessary to assess for bone marrow involvement, which is common in DHL.\n3. PET-CT scan: This imaging modality is useful for staging and assessing the extent of disease involvement. It can help identify any extranodal sites of involvement and determine the patient's Ann Arbor stage.\n4. Molecular studies: Although not part of the standard risk stratification models, molecular markers such as BMI1 and WT1 expression may provide additional prognostic information.\n\nOnce the diagnosis is confirmed, and the stage is determined, the patient should be treated with an intensive chemotherapy regimen, such as R-EPOCH (rituximab, etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin).

        "answer": "Based on the patient's history, current status, and the results of the next-generation sequencing, an appropriate next therapy for his progressive disease could be enzalutamide or apalutamide. Both of these drugs are androgen receptor inhibitors and have been shown to improve metastasis-free survival in patients with non-metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer.\n\nEnzalutamide is a once-daily oral medication that works by preventing the androgen receptor from binding to androgen, which in turn inhibits the growth of prostate cancer cells. In a study of men with non-metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer, enzalutamide was shown to significantly reduce the risk of metastasis or death compared to placebo.\n\nApalutamide is also a once-daily oral medication that works by blocking the androgen receptor from entering the cell nucleus, which prevents it from promoting tumor growth. In a study of men with non-metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer, apalutamide was shown to significantly reduce the risk of metastasis or death compared to placebo.\n\nIt is important to note that the patient's PSA level has risen despite being on abiraterone + prednisone, which is an indication that the cancer is progressing. The patient's bone pain has improved, but the new liver lesions and the increased uptake in three different bone lesions on the bone scan are signs of progressive disease.\n\nIt is also important to consider the patient's overall health, any comorbidities, and potential side effects of the treatment. Both enzalutamide and apalutamide can cause fatigue, hot flashes, and hypertension. Enzalutamide can also cause seizures in rare cases.\n\nIn summary, an appropriate next therapy for this patient's progressive disease could be enzalutamide or apalutamide, both of which are androgen receptor inhibitors that have been shown to improve metastasis-free survival in patients with non-metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer. It is important to consider the patient's overall health, any comorbidities, and potential side effects of the treatment when making a decision.",

        "answer": "Based on the information provided, this patient has metastatic prostate cancer with a high PSA level and evidence of bone metastases. The patient has been on bicalutamide for 2 weeks, which is an anti-androgen therapy. The best treatment plan for this patient would be a combination of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and chemotherapy.\n\nThe androgen deprivation therapy can be achieved through medical or surgical castration. Medical castration can be done using LHRH agonists such as leuprolide or goserelin, or LHRH antagonists such as degarelix. Surgical castration involves bilateral orchiectomy. In addition to ADT, chemotherapy with docetaxel is recommended for patients with metastatic prostate cancer.\n\nThe recommended treatment plan for this patient would be:\n\n1. ADT: Medical or surgical castration.\n2. Chemotherapy: Docetaxel 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks for 6 cycles.\n3. Bisphosphonate therapy with zoledronic acid or denosumab to prevent skeletal-related events.\n4. Palliative radiation therapy to the bone metastases to alleviate pain.\n5.

        "answer": "Given the patient's history of metastatic prostate cancer to the bone, his castration-resistant status, and the absence of visceral disease, an appropriate next step for his treatment would be to consider bone-targeted agents to prevent or treat therapy-related bone loss and to consider chemohormonal therapy.\n\nOne option would be to add denosumab to his current treatment regimen. Denosumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets RANKL, a key mediator of bone resorption. In the context of metastatic prostate cancer, denosumab has been shown to decrease the incidence of new vertebral fractures in men receiving ADT. The recommended dose of denosumab is 120 mg subcutaneously every 4 weeks.\n\nAnother option would be to consider chemohormonal therapy with docetaxel. The CHAARTED study showed that adding docetaxel to ADT improved overall survival in men with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. The study also suggested that chemohormonal therapy may be particularly appropriate for men with high-volume metastatic disease. The recommended dose of docetaxel is 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks for 6 cycles.\n\nIt's important to note that the patient's PSA level and the extent of his bone metastases should be taken into account when making treatment decisions. Additionally, the patient's functional status and overall health should also be considered. Regular monitoring of the patient's PSA level, bone scans and CT scans should be done to assess the response to treatment and to detect any progression of disease.\n\nIt's also important to consider the potential side effects of treatment, such as bone pain, fatigue, and neutropenia, and to manage them appropriately. The patient should also be counseled about the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle, including regular exercise and a balanced diet, to help manage the side effects of treatment and improve overall health.",
