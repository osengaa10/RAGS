Specifically, based on the information provided, I would recommend considering an FGFR inhibitor, as the patient has an FGFR2 mutation.\n\nOne such FGFR inhibitor that has been studied in urothelial carcinoma is erdafitinib. In a phase II trial, erdafitinib demonstrated a response rate of 40% in patients with FGFR alterations who had progressed on or after prior chemotherapy (Siefker-Radtke et al. 2018). However, the use of erdafitinib as a first-line treatment for metastatic bladder cancer has not been studied.\n\nIt is important to note that the patient's history of hypertension and chronic kidney disease with a baseline creatinine of 2 may impact her treatment options. Erdafitinib is associated with an increased risk of hyperphosphatemia, which may require dose adjustments or temporary discontinuation in patients with renal impairment. Therefore, close monitoring of renal function and electrolytes will be necessary during treatment.\n\nIn summary, based on the information provided, I would recommend considering an FGFR inhibitor such as erdafitinib as the appropriate first-line treatment for this patient with metastatic bladder cancer and an FGFR2 mutation. However, close monitoring of renal function and electrolytes will be necessary during treatment.\n\nReferences:\nSiefker-Radtke AO, Necchi A, Park SH, et al.

        "answer": "The most appropriate next step in management for this patient with relapsed stage IV cHL would be to consider salvage chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT). Given the patient's young age and good performance status, they are likely to be a candidate for ASCT.\n\nOne option for salvage chemotherapy is the ICE regimen (ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide), which has been shown to be effective in relapsed/refractory HL. Other options include the DHAP regimen (dexamethasone, cytarabine, and cisplatin) or the GDP regimen (gemcitabine, dexamethasone, and cisplatin). The choice of salvage regimen may depend on the patient's previous treatment history and any toxicities they experienced during their initial ABVD therapy.\n\nAfter achieving a response to salvage chemotherapy, the patient would then proceed to ASCT. This involves collecting and storing the patient's own stem cells, administering high-dose chemotherapy to eradicate the remaining cancer cells, and then reinfusing the stored stem cells to promote bone marrow recovery.\n\nIt's important to note that the patient's PET/CT shows diffuse disease, which suggests a more aggressive relapse. In this case, the patient may benefit from the addition of brentuximab vedotin, an anti-CD30 monoclonal antibody, to their salvage chemotherapy regimen. Brentuximab vedotin has been shown to be effective in relapsed/refractory HL and can improve response rates and progression-free survival when added to salvage chemotherapy.\n\nOverall, the most appropriate next step in management for this patient with relapsed stage IV cHL would be to consider salvage chemotherapy followed by ASCT, with the addition of brentuximab vedotin as a potential consideration.",

        "answer": "Given the patient's age, stage of disease, performance status, and comorbidities, the most reasonable treatment recommendation would be a regimen with reduced toxicity. A clinical trial of PET-guided radiotherapy in patients with advanced stage Hodgkin lymphoma (Lancet 2012; 379: 1791\u20131799) found that a regimen of ABVD (doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine) plus involved-field radiotherapy resulted in a 5-year progression-free survival rate of 80.8% and an overall survival rate of 92.2%. However, the use of bleomycin in this regimen may be associated with pulmonary toxicity, particularly in elderly patients, as noted in a study of patients older than 60 years with classical Hodgkin lymphoma treated with front line ABVD chemotherapy (Br J Haematol . 2015;170(2):179\u2013184).\n\nGiven the patient's comorbidities and frailty, a regimen of AVD (doxorubicin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine) without bleomycin may be a more appropriate treatment option. A study by Forero-Torres et al. (J Clin Oncol . 2017;35(27):3134-3140) found that AVD was non-inferior to ABVD in terms of progression-free survival and overall survival in patients with advanced-stage Hodgkin lymphoma. The study also found that AVD was associated with less hematologic toxicity and fewer pulmonary events than ABVD.\n\nTherefore, I would recommend a regimen of AVD (doxorubicin 25 mg/m2, vinblastine 6 mg/m2, and dacarbazine 375 mg/m2) given on days 1 and 15 of a 28-day cycle for 6 cycles. The patient should also receive involved-field radiotherapy after chemotherapy if the PET scan shows residual disease. The patient's blood pressure, blood glucose, and cardiac function should be closely monitored during treatment. The patient should also receive appropriate supportive care, including prophylaxis for neutropenic fever and management of his comorbidities.",
