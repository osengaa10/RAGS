Her PD-L1 score is <1%.\n\nThe current standard of care for first-line treatment of metastatic bladder cancer is anti-VEGF targeted drugs, such as sunitinib, pazopanib, or bevacizumab. However, given the patient's FGFR2 mutation, she may benefit from targeted therapy with erdafitinib, an FGFR inhibitor. Erdafitinib has been shown to have clinical activity in patients with advanced or metastatic bladder cancer harboring FGFR2 or FGFR3 mutations.\n\nIt is important to note that the patient's chronic kidney disease may affect her eligibility for certain treatments. Erdafitinib is primarily eliminated by the kidneys, and its use in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min) is not recommended. Therefore, the patient's renal function should be closely monitored, and dose adjustments may be necessary.\n\nIn summary, the appropriate first-line treatment for this patient may be erdafitinib, an FGFR inhibitor, given her FGFR2 mutation.

Patients at high risk for recurrence after \nnephrectomy include those with positive lymph nodes, high Fuhrman grade, extension beyond the Gerota fascia, or extension into the renal vein or vena cava. The results of S-TRAC suggest for the first time that adjuvant therapy in selected patients may be of benefit. Additional studies of VEGF inhibitors and anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 therapies \nwill further shape this landscape. Cytoreductive nephrectomy for \npatients with metastatic disease may enhance responsiveness to systemic therapy and also remains the standard treatment modality for patients receiving antiangiogenesis and immunotherapy drugs.

        "answer": "The optimal management of this patient's muscle-invasive bladder cancer would be bladder-sparing multimodal therapy, which integrates radiotherapy and cisplatin-based chemotherapy as an alternative to surgical cystectomy. This approach has been shown to have comparable long-term oncologic outcomes to radical cystectomy in well-selected patients.\n\nHere is a detailed treatment regimen:\n\n1. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy: A cisplatin-based combination therapy, such as gemcitabine-cisplatin (GC) or methotrexate-vinblastine-Adriamycin-cisplatin (MVAC), should be administered for 2-3 cycles before the start of radiotherapy and concurrent chemotherapy.\n2. Radiotherapy: External beam radiation therapy should be delivered in daily fractions, typically over 5-7 weeks, with a total dose of 64-66 Gy.\n3. Concurrent chemotherapy: Cisplatin should be administered weekly during radiotherapy at a dose of 40 mg/m2.\n4. Close follow-up: Regular cystoscopies and imaging studies should be performed to monitor the patient's response to treatment and detect any recurrence early.\n\nIt is essential to note that the patient's tumor characteristics, such as size, location, and associated hydronephrosis, should be carefully evaluated before deciding on bladder-sparing multimodal therapy. Patients with hydronephrosis or incomplete TURBT may have a lower likelihood of achieving complete response to chemoradiation therapy and bladder preservation. However, these factors do not necessarily preclude successful bladder preservation.\n\nIn addition, the patient's preferences and overall health status should be taken into account when making treatment decisions. In this case, the patient's strong preference to avoid a urostomy is an essential consideration.\n\nOverall, bladder-sparing multimodal therapy can be an effective and well-tolerated treatment option for patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer who are not candidates for or decline surgical cystectomy.",

The clinical stage, which is determined through pathologic evaluation of the TURBT specimen, drives subsequent treatment approaches. In general, bladder cancer can be categorized \ninto three groups: non–muscle-invasive disease (including Ta, Tis and \nT1 cancers), muscle-invasive localized disease, and advanced cancer. T reatment approaches for each are described in detail.\nTransurethral Resection of Bladder Tumor\nTURBT is the foundation of bladder cancer diagnosis, staging, and treatment. It involves a cutting resectoscope loop that can fully eradicate tumors ranging in size from a few millimeters to several centimeters. A bimanual examination should be performed before and after TURBT \nto evaluate for possible presence of fixed disease suggestive of T3 local \ninvasion. With use of a 1-cm cutting loop, resection proceeds in a stepwise fashion, starting with superficial tumor. Once the surgeon reaches the tumor base, additional resection is performed to achieve lateral resection margins and deep resection to include the muscularis propria, important staging tools. To provide a detailed operative account \nand aid further treatment decision making, the surgeon should note \nthe appearance and number of tumors, tumor location, status of the ureteral orifices, and extent of resection (visibly complete or incomplete), and presence or absence of bladder perforation.\nSome clinical circumstances during TURBT warrant particular \nmention.

De Bruin and coworkers \ndemonstrated a significant reduction in the incidence of second breast \ncancers in women treated with mediastinal RT compared with mantle RT for HL, and a meta-analysis of HL trials by Franklin and coworkers showed a marked decrease in second cancers in patients receiving IFRT compared with EFRT.\n32,33 However, because mediastinal nodes are \ninvolved in the majority of patients with HL, most patients undergoing RT for HL continue to have at least modest exposure to the heart, lungs, and breasts regardless of efforts to administer only involved-site \nRT. The 2012 publication of a randomized trial of ABVD alone versus \nradiation-based therapy in limited stage HL showing for the first time a survival advantage in the chemotherapy alone arm, despite an inferior PFS, confirms the need to consider both efficacy and late toxicity in treatment decisions.\n28 Current guidelines and recommendations",
            "In advanced disease, many centres treat patients with intensive \npoly-chemotherapy alone (especially in the absence of bulky disease). Only if a CR is not achieved will localized additive RT be \nused for residual lymphoma after full chemotherapy [311, 312]. The \ntarget in this situation is the residual mass after chemotherapy [313].\nIn advanced-stage HL two PET-based ABVD escalation or \nBEACOPP de-escalation trials aimed at determining the feasibility \nof omitting radiotherapy in interim PET-negative patients. Patients \nwith a [18F] FDG-PET positive residual tumour after the end of \nchemotherapy (escalated BEACOPP or ABVD × 6 or Stanford V) \nshould receive local radiotherapy with 30 Gy [314–316].\nNodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma \nearly-stage IA\nNodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (NLPHL) \n(stage IA) is treated with IFRT alone. The guidelines of the German \nHodgkin Study Group (GHSG) for NLPHL recommend a dose of \n30 Gy as sufficient [317, 318]. All fields are treated with fractions of \n1.8 to 2.0 Gy, depending on the field size and patient tolerance. No \nadvantage has been shown for doses over 30 to 35 Gy, which is the \nrecommended dose to the CTV [319].\nNodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma \n>stage IA\nNLPHL (>stage IA) is treated according to (the same stage) CHL \nwith combined-modality therapy (chemotherapy followed by \nIFRT) [320, 321].\nOngoing clinical trials will help to clarify the role of systemic \nchemotherapy or antibody-based approaches in the treatment of \nthese patients.\nPaediatric Hodgkin lymphoma\nA full review of RT for paediatric HL is beyond the scope of this \nchapter.

CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisolone) has also been proposed as an alternative to ABVD and in a small study of 29 \nolder adult patients treated with CHOP-21, the CR rate was 93% \nwith 2 treatment-related deaths.\n73 Three-year OS and PFS rates were \n79% and 76%, respectively.\nOngoing efforts to incorporate the very active and well-tolerated \ndrug BV into first-line therapy may benefit older patients both in \nterms of improved efficacy and tolerability. Single-agent BV had a \n92% overall response rate (ORR) and 73% CR rate in 27 patients 60 years of age or older with newly diagnosed HL.\n74 Unfortunately, \nthe median remission duration was only 9.1 months, and 30% of patients experienced grade 3 peripheral neuropathy. Preliminary results of combinations of BV with dacarbazine or bendamustine in patients \n60 years of age or older show response rates of 100%, which in early \nfollow-up appear more durable than single-agent BV.\n75 However, despite \ndose reductions, the combination of BV and bendamustine was poorly tolerated in this study of older patients with excessive hematologic and neurologic toxicity. Older patients, regardless of age, should be treated \nwith curative intent unless life-threatening comorbidities are present.\nTherapy of Hodgkin Lymphoma in HIV\nIn the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), outcomes \nand therapy recommendations for HL in HIV-infected individuals mirror those of the non-HIV population.

This approach has been shown to be sufficient and less toxic compared to more intensive regimens.\n\nIt is important to monitor the patient's response to treatment and adjust the treatment plan as necessary.

Inferior outcomes are attributable to higher IPS scores at diagnosis, as well as comorbid conditions that increase the morbidity and mortality associated with therapy.\n67 Patients older than 60 years \nof age are not candidates for aggressive regimens such as escBEACOPP and are often not eligible for salvage regimens incorporating ASCT. Proctor and coworkers reported a 14% toxic death rate during or \nimmediately after completion of treatment in a series of 35 patients \n60 years of age and older who received standard ABVD chemotherapy.\n68 \nCauses of death were sepsis in 4 patients and bleomycin pulmonary toxicity in 1 patient. Evens and coworkers reported a much higher incidence of bleomycin lung toxicity in patients older than 60 years \nof age, especially those receiving concurrent granulocyte colony-\nstimulating factor (G-CSF).\n69 In this retrospective analysis of 92 HL \npatients aged 60 to 89 years, 32% of patients developed bleomycin lung toxicity, which was associated with a 25% mortality rate. Analysis of the large randomized trial of ABVD versus Stanford V showed the \n5-year FFS for older adult patients was 48% and OS was 58%, sig -\nnificantly worse than for non–older adult patients (FFS, 74%; OS, \n90%).\n70 Interestingly, the time to progression (TTP) was similar for \nyounger and older patients, but deaths without progression were significantly higher in older patients.

            "evaluation can be reserved for those with diagnosed muscle-invasive disease.\nPRIMARY THERAPY\nPrimary therapy for bladder cancer relies on initial staging from a TURBT (see Fig. 80.6). The clinical stage, which is determined through pathologic evaluation of the TURBT specimen, drives subsequent treatment approaches. In general, bladder cancer can be categorized \ninto three groups: non–muscle-invasive disease (including Ta, Tis and \nT1 cancers), muscle-invasive localized disease, and advanced cancer. T reatment approaches for each are described in detail.\nTransurethral Resection of Bladder Tumor\nTURBT is the foundation of bladder cancer diagnosis, staging, and treatment. It involves a cutting resectoscope loop that can fully eradicate tumors ranging in size from a few millimeters to several centimeters. A bimanual examination should be performed before and after TURBT \nto evaluate for possible presence of fixed disease suggestive of T3 local \ninvasion. With use of a 1-cm cutting loop, resection proceeds in a stepwise fashion, starting with superficial tumor. Once the surgeon reaches the tumor base, additional resection is performed to achieve lateral resection margins and deep resection to include the muscularis propria, important staging tools. To provide a detailed operative account \nand aid further treatment decision making, the surgeon should note \nthe appearance and number of tumors, tumor location, status of the ureteral orifices, and extent of resection (visibly complete or incomplete), and presence or absence of bladder perforation.\nSome clinical circumstances during TURBT warrant particular \nmention. T umor size and location can represent challenges to the \noperating urologist. Large tumors may cause bleeding and difficult",

For patients with MIBC who are not cystectomy candidates, or those motivated \nto preserve their native bladders, trimodality therapy offers a well-studied \nalternative.\n80,132 This treatment regimen involves a maximal TURBT \nas is safely possible, followed by concurrent chemoradiation therapy. Many published trials have stopped the radiation at approximately \n40 G y to allow an early cystoscopic evaluation of tumor response. \nPatients who have an incomplete response and are suitable for surgery proceed to immediate cystectomy, whereas the remainder receive \nadditional chemoradiation with a total radiation dose of 64 to 65  G y. \nTable 80.3  Select Prospective Clinical Trials and Large Institutional Studies of Trimodality Bladder \nPreservation Therapy for Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer\nN Clinical Stage Concurrent ChemotherapyComplete \nResponse (%)Five-Y ear Overall Survival (%)\nPHASE II TRIALS\nKaufman14953 T2–T4 Nx Cisplatin 78 48\nHousset15254 T2–T4 Nany Cisplatin, 5-FU 74 (3 yr) 59\nChoudhury13950 T2–T3 N0 Gemcitabine 88a65\nZapatero14533 T2–T4 N0 Cisplatin 88 65\nRTOG pooled137468 72 57\n R TOG 8802150T2–T4a N0–2 Cisplatin\n R TOG 8903b,141T2–T4a Nx Cisplatin\n R TOG 9506190T2–T4a Nx Cisplatin, 5-FU\n R TOG 9706191T2–T4a N0 Cisplatin\n R TOG 9906192T2–T4a N0 Cisplatin, paclitaxel\n R TOG 0233 T2–T4a Nx Cisplatin, paclitaxel vs cisplatin, 5-FU\nPHASE III TRIALS\nRTOG 8903141123 T2–T4a Nx Cisplatin 55 vs 61 48–49\nBC2001136360 T2–T4a N0 None vs 5-FU, mitomycin C — 35 vs 48\nLARGE INSTITUTIONAL SERIES\nErlangen135415 T1–T4 Nany Varied 72c51\nItaly146121 T2–T4 Nx Varied 86 68\nMGH134348 T2–T4a N0 Varied 72 52\naAssessed 3 months after completion of chemoradiation.\nbPhase III trial.\ncAssessed 6 weeks after completion of (chemo)radiation.",
            "may be useful in some BCG nonresponders.\nIntravesical Therapy With Chemotherapeutic Agents\nThe most common chemotherapeutic agent used as intravesical therapy for NMIBC is mitomycin C. Mitomycin C is an alkylating agent that inhibits DNA synthesis and is most efficacious when given within 24 hours of TURBT. For patients with low-grade bladder cancer, a single \ndose of 40  mg of mitomy cin C can be administered after TURBT. \nFor recurrent low-grade disease, an induction dose is given within 24 hours of TURBT, followed by weekly treatment for 6 to 8 weeks at \ndoses between 20 and 60  mg. M itomycin C causes significantly fewer \nlower urinary tract side effects than other intravesical agents because of its high molecular weight and minimal systemic absorption. Efficacy has been shown to improve with urine alkalinization and microwave warming.\n90–92\nOther intravesical chemotherapeutic agents include thiotepa, and \ndoxorubicin derivatives such as epirubicin and valrubicin. Thiotepa is an alkylating agent and represents the only chemotherapeutic agent approved by the FDA specifically for intravesical treatment of bladder \ncancer. Hematopoietic side effects are occasionally seen because of of subsequent ureteral stricture. These tumors may warrant ureteroscopic \nevaluation to rule out upper tract disease and often require ureteral \nstent placement to aid healing and prevent obstruction. If trigonal \ntumors extend more proximally to the bladder neck, it may be prudent to perform biopsies of the prostatic urethra (or bladder neck) to rule out involvement and aid in subsequent operative planning. Similarly, if a velvety erythematous appearance of CIS is noted, random bladder biopsies and additional biopsies within the prostatic urethra are sug -\ngested for assessment of the local extent of disease. Regardless of tumor \nlocation or size, the fundamental principles remain the same. Initial",

False-positive rates can be diminished by delaying BLC to 3 months after intravesical therapy,\n74 and also \nimprove with experience.75 Based on this evidence, the AUA non–muscle \ninvasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) guidelines recommend offering BLC at the time of TURBT, if available, to increase detection and decrease recurrence (moderate recommendation, evidence strength  \nGrade B).\n66\nAnother example of enhanced cystoscopy used in NMIBC evaluation \nis narrow band imaging (NBI). NBI filters white light into two \nwavelengths: 415  nm (blue) and 540  nm (gr een). Through use of \nthese wavelengths, NBI capitalizes on peak absorption of hemoglobin, which accentuates vascular architecture of bladder tumors compared with normal urothelium. Benefits of NBI include the absence of an instillation agent, which avoids time delay and cost. However, several \nstudies have demonstrated a lower risk of bladder cancer recurrence \nwith use of NBI. Whereas one trial demonstrated a lower cancer recurrence rate at 3 months (OR, 0.62 [95% CI, 0.41–0.92]) and 12 months (OR, 0.24 [95% CI, 0.07–0.81]),\n76 another trial failed to \nshow a difference in recurrence risk at 1 year compared with WLC among patients with multiple tumors.\n77 Given conflicting results, the \nAUA NMIBC guidelines state that clinicians “may consider” use of NBI to increase detection and decrease recurrence (conditional recom -\nmendation; evidence strength Grade C).\n66\nEvaluation for bladder cancer also involves urine cytologic assess-\nment, which is the pathologic evaluation of changes in disaggregated cells under light microscopy.\n69 Although cytology can be used to detect"

Repeat transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT): Given the high rates of upstaging in patients with T1 disease, particularly if no muscle is present in the initial resection specimen, it is recommended to perform a repeat TURBT within 6 weeks of the initial resection. This will help ensure complete resection of the tumor and provide more accurate staging information.\n2. Intravesical therapy: For high-grade T1 disease, intravesical BCG is a common initial approach following TURBT. The use of induction and maintenance BCG is preferred over observation, especially if carcinoma in situ (CIS) is noted on initial TURBT.\n3. Consideration for early cystectomy: Certain histologic features, such as micropapillary or nested variants, warrant strong consideration for early cystectomy due to their aggressive natural history. Additionally, recurrent T1 disease, larger tumor burden, and younger age are also characteristics commonly used for cystectomy consideration.\n\nIn summary, I would recommend a repeat TURBT, intravesical BCG therapy, and close monitoring for signs of recurrence or progression. The patient's case should be discussed in a multidisciplinary tumor board to determine the most appropriate treatment approach, including the potential need for early cystectomy.",

Although this classification is used in official pathologic AJCC staging, there is no discrete evidence that \ndepth of muscle invasion predicts overall or disease-free survival.\n62\nClinical staging follows a similar scheme, but understaging is \ncommon. Approximately 27% of T1 tumors are upstaged after radical \ncystectomy, and some series have reported that more than 50% of T2 tumors are upstaged to T3.\n63 Furthermore, in two large studies, 19% \nto 35% of patients with clinically node-negative MIBC were found to have positive nodes at cystectomy pathologic assessment.\n64,65 High \nrates of upstaging have also been shown after repeat transurethral resection. Of those patients with T1 disease on the first resection, 30% were found to have T2 cancer: 15% if muscle was present in \nthe original specimen, but up to 40% if no muscle was present. These \nhigh rates of upstaging led to the American Urological Association (AUA) guideline recommendation for repeat transurethral resection within 6 weeks of initial resection in patients with T1 disease, even if muscularis propria is present in the resection specimen and uninvolved.\n66\nCLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS\nBladder cancer is most often associated with the classic sign of gross, painless hematuria, occurring in approximately 85% of patients, with the remainder exhibiting microhematuria.\n67 Patients with gross \nhematuria should undergo evaluation for bladder cancer with particular attention to the characterization of hematuria as initial, terminal, or total to better localize the source.

            "evaluation can be reserved for those with diagnosed muscle-invasive disease.\nPRIMARY THERAPY\nPrimary therapy for bladder cancer relies on initial staging from a TURBT (see Fig. 80.6). The clinical stage, which is determined through pathologic evaluation of the TURBT specimen, drives subsequent treatment approaches. In general, bladder cancer can be categorized \ninto three groups: non–muscle-invasive disease (including Ta, Tis and \nT1 cancers), muscle-invasive localized disease, and advanced cancer. T reatment approaches for each are described in detail.\nTransurethral Resection of Bladder Tumor\nTURBT is the foundation of bladder cancer diagnosis, staging, and treatment. It involves a cutting resectoscope loop that can fully eradicate tumors ranging in size from a few millimeters to several centimeters. A bimanual examination should be performed before and after TURBT \nto evaluate for possible presence of fixed disease suggestive of T3 local \ninvasion. With use of a 1-cm cutting loop, resection proceeds in a stepwise fashion, starting with superficial tumor. Once the surgeon reaches the tumor base, additional resection is performed to achieve lateral resection margins and deep resection to include the muscularis propria, important staging tools. To provide a detailed operative account \nand aid further treatment decision making, the surgeon should note \nthe appearance and number of tumors, tumor location, status of the ureteral orifices, and extent of resection (visibly complete or incomplete), and presence or absence of bladder perforation.\nSome clinical circumstances during TURBT warrant particular \nmention. T umor size and location can represent challenges to the \noperating urologist. Large tumors may cause bleeding and difficult",
            "1389 Carcinoma \tof \tthe \tBladder\t•\tCHAPTER\t80\t\nBecause upper tract disease is an additional concern in the setting \nof hematuria, an essential addition to cystoscopic evaluation is upper \ntract evaluation for urothelial tumors and to assess possible obstruction of the upper tract due to bladder cancer. The upper urinary tract \ncollecting system can be evaluated with an intravenous pyelogram \n(IVP), a retrograde pyelogram (performed with anesthetic), or most commonly a computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance urogram. Less than 2% of patients with a papillary bladder lesion will develop an upper tract tumor; however, stage, grade, and tumor volume do not correlate with the risk of upper tract cancer, illustrating the \nimportance of upper tract imaging studies as part of the workup for \nall patients.\n78,79\nIf hematuria workup uncovers muscle-invasive disease, further \nevaluation is warranted to search for possible metastatic disease. This includes a complete blood count, chemistry profile including alkaline phosphatase (for bone metastasis), chest imaging, and abdominal and \npelvic CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). If alkaline phosphatase \nis elevated or the patient has symptoms suggestive of metastatic disease, a bone scan is warranted.\n80\nIn summary, initial evaluation for bladder cancer requires local \ncystourethroscopy with voided (or preferably barbotage) cytologic specimen and upper tract evaluation. If urothelial abnormalities are noted, an outpatient transurethral resection or biopsy is performed \nalong with a formal bimanual examination under anesthesia. Metastatic \nevaluation can be reserved for those with diagnosed muscle-invasive disease.\nPRIMARY THERAPY\nPrimary therapy for bladder cancer relies on initial staging from a TURBT (see Fig. 80.6).

Unfortunately, at the moment, none \nof these tests has reached an acceptable accuracy (sensitivity and \nsensibility) to be implemented in daily clinical practices [199].\nTransurethral resection of tumour\nTURT is performed under complete or regional anaesthesia, with \nan operative cystoscope incorporating a diathermic or bipolar loop \n(resectoscope). TURT is a diagnostic procedure allowing patholog -\nical confirmation of bladder urothelial carcinoma but it is also the first step for NMIBC treatment. Pathological analyses confirm the \ndiagnostic of urothelial carcinoma, grades the tumour and sepa -\nrates patient among two main prognostic groups that will deter -\nmine the therapeutic strategy: MIBC or NMIBC. In the setting of \nNMIBC, recurrence and progression to MIBC can be predicted \nbased on the EORTC scoring system and risk tables [205]. Risk fac -\ntors for recurrence are the number of tumours, tumour diameter, \nprior recurrence rate, tumour stage (Ta or T1), presence of concur -\nrent CIS and 1973 WHO tumour grade. Automatic calculators of \nrisk groups predicting recurrence and progression at one and five \nyears can be downloaded online on computers or smartphones for \neasier daily clinical use. (< http://www.eortc.be/tools/bladdercalcu -\nlator/> ). European guidelines panel recommends stratification of \nNMIBC patients in to three risk groups allowing adapted therapeu -\ntic strategies [199] (see Tables 45.4 and 45.6).\nTreatment of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer\nA complete TURT is the first step in NMIBC management. Since \nhigh incidence recurrence (30–60%) and progression (≈10%) is \npart of the disease natural history [205], adjuvant therapy is a valu -\nable part of treatment.Table 45.5  Risk group stratification according to 2011 EAU guidelines\nLow-risk tumours Primary, solitary, Ta, G1* (PUNLMP , LG),\n<3 cm, no CIS\nIntermediate-risk \ntumoursAll tumours not defined in the two adjacent categories",

BCG is reconstituted with 50  mL of saline, instilled thr ough \na urethral catheter under gravity, retained in the bladder for approxi -\nmately 2 hours, and drained. Fluid restriction before administration is recommended to avoid dilution during treatment. Although the mechanism for its efficacy remains unknown, an intact host immune \nresponse appears to be necessary.

This malignancy, which occurs in children younger than 2 years, appears as abnormal bleeding or discharge in addition to the presence of a vaginal mass. As in its ovarian counterpart, AFP can be detected and can be used as a serum tumor marker. T reatment consists of chemotherapy (vincristine, actinomycin D, and cyclophosphamide), surgical excision, and, occasionally, radiation therapy.\n\nIn this case, since the tumor has ruptured the ovarian capsule, there is a risk of residual disease and recurrence. Therefore, chemotherapy is recommended to eliminate any potential residual disease and reduce the risk of recurrence. The AFP level can be used to monitor the response to treatment, with a decrease indicating a response to therapy.\n\nIt is important to note that the specific chemotherapy regimen and duration of treatment may vary based on the patient's individual case and response to therapy, and should be determined by a healthcare professional experienced in the treatment of yolk sac tumors.

More commonly, yolk sac tumors in adults are found in combination with other tumor types, occurring in up to 70% of GCTs. In one series of 459 patients \nwith stage I and II testicular cancer, the most common histologic type \nobserved was a mixed one consisting of embryonal carcinoma plus yolk sac tumor and teratoma. Furthermore, the presence of teratoma and yolk sac tumor appeared to be associated with a large primary tumor size.\n45 Although pure yolk sac tumors are conventionally \nconsidered to be more aggressive with early hematogenous distribution,40 \nsome histologic reviews have suggested that patients in whom yolk sac tumor elements are present are at lower risk of relapse than patients nodal involvement occurs in 15% of patients, but in virtually every case with contralateral involvement, ipsilateral nodes were also involved. Left testis tumors most frequently have nodal spread to the left paraaortic, preaortic, and interaortocaval nodes, in that order.

She recognized that something did \nchange in her abdomen about six months ago. Because of increasing \ncomplaints she saw her general practitioner who sent her to have an \nabdominal CT scan. The CT scan revealed a bilateral adnexal mass, \nascites, and an enlarged omentum. CA 125 was elevated to 1.250 \nU/ml. Our pretherapeutic workup included a clinical gynaecologic \nexamination, vaginal ultrasound, CT scan of the thorax, and a refer -\nral to our pre-anaesthetic outpatient service regarding the planned \ncyto-reductive surgery. We confirmed the already described lesions \nhighly suspicious for ovarian cancer.

Embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (sarcoma botryoides) is a \nhighly malignant sarcoma that occurs in children age 6 years or younger \n(mean age, 1.8 years). This sarcoma generally appears as soft nodules that fill and protrude from the vagina or as abnormal bleeding. The prognosis for patients with this malignancy has improved with the use of multimodality therapy including surgery, polyagent chemo -\ntherapy, and radiation.\n465\nEndodermal Sinus Tumors\nEndodermal sinus tumors are rare germ cell malignancies that occur primarily in the ovary but have been reported to occur at extragonadal sites, including the vagina. This vaginal malignancy, which occurs in children younger than 2 years, appears as abnormal bleeding \nor discharge in addition to the presence of a vaginal mass. As in \nits ovarian counterpart, α-fetoprotein can be detected and can be \nused as a serum tumor marker. T reatment consists of chemotherapy (vincristine, actinomycin D, and cyclophosphamide), surgical excision, and, occasionally, radiation therapy.\nMelanoma\nVaginal melanomas are rare and account for 2.7% of vaginal malignancies.\n466–468 Three percent of malignant melanomas involve \nthe female genital tract, with the vulva the most common site of occurrence. Melanomas arising in the vagina are thought to originate from in situ melanocytes in areas of melanosis or atypical melanocytic \nhyperplasia. These malignancies occur at a mean age of 55 years, with \nan age range of 22 to 83 years. Patients typically are first seen with abnormal vaginal bleeding, discharge, or a mass. These tumors most commonly occur in the lower one-third of the vagina on the anterior wall and appear as a blue-black or black-brown mass or plaque. They have a poor prognosis, with 5-year survival rates of 15% to 20%.\n466–468",

A study of 171 patients \nwith craniopharyngioma revealed that patients diagnosed before 10 years of age had higher rates of visual and endocrine dysfunction and social dysfunction.\n698\nThe fundamentals of craniopharyngioma treatment emphasize local \ncontrol. Chemotherapy is ineffective for initial or recurrent tumor, and metastatic disease is reported. Local treatment involves surgery, radiation, or both. However, little progress has been made to determine \nthe best strategy—gross total resection with radiation therapy reserved \nfor residual or recurrent tumor versus surgical biopsy, cyst drainage, and radiation. Complete surgical resection is often curative and obviates the need for radiation therapy in a majority of cases.\n699 When postoperative \nMRI and intraoperative visual assessment show no evidence of tumor, CSF β-hCG greater than 50 mIU/dL clearly indicates the presence \nof NGGCT and may obviate the need for either diagnostic biopsy or extensive surgical resection pending response to chemotherapy and \nradiation therapy. By contrast, complete resection is curative for \nwell-differentiated teratomas, whereas chemotherapy and radiation therapies are ineffective with this tumor. The extent of surgical resection is less important for germinomas, which are exquisitely sensitive to chemotherapy and radiation therapy, or for the malignant NGGCTs, which frequently spread throughout the CSF and are less responsive to irradiation and chemotherapy.\nCraniospinal irradiation is clearly indicated in cases of documented \nleptomeningeal metastasis from germinoma; however, its use in patients with normal findings on CSF examination and spinal MRI is con -\ntroversial.

The overall goal is \nto rapidly identify treatable patient subsets or occult primary lesions \nthrough a rational, focused approach.\nHistory and Physical Examination\nA thorough history and physical examination, including a detailed review of systems, is mandatory because it may elicit symptoms or signs that were not immediately brought to the physician’s atten-tion. Attention should also be paid to a history of previous biopsies, \nas well as spontaneously regressing lesions. The family history can \nbe helpful, especially if the patient belongs to a specific genetically predisposed ethnic group that is known to be at high risk for malignancies at specific sites (e.g., Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry and risk for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations causing breast, ovarian, and  \npancreatic cancer).\nSerum Tumor Markers\nNo tumor marker is diagnostic in determining the primary site in CUP .\n9 β-Human chorionic gonadotropin ( β-hCG) and α-fetoprotein \n(AFP) are indicated in patients with CUP with a midline tumor and a concern for extragonadal germ cell cancer.

Based on these results, the checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab received breakthrough therapy designation for MSI-H advanced colorectal cancers. Trials examining this approach for adjuvant treatment of early colorectal cancer and any cancers with an MSI phenotype are underway. Ultimately, there appears to be a clear link among DNA repair deficiency, mutational landscape, predicted neoantigen load, and clinical activity of immune checkpoint inhibitors. The role of somatic tumor mutational load and spectrum in priming the immune system in tumors is a fascinating new approach to linking personalized cancer genomic profiling and immunotherapy.Box 11.1.

GVHD is often associated with gastrointestinal abnormalities, including diarrhea, abdominal pain, and elevated serum bilirubin levels. Both diseases \ncan occur concurrently. Unfortunately, acute GVHD can be clinically \nand histologically indistinguishable from HFS in its early stages. The distinction of acral erythema from GVHD in patients who have undergone a transplant is important because the treatments are distinct.\n68\nErythema multiforme\nIn contrast to HFS, erythema multiforme manifests classically as target-shaped macules on the palms and soles. This condition is most commonly associated with herpes simplex virus infections or myco -\nplasma infections.\nT reatment\nMost treatment recommendations for the management of HFS are based on case reports, case series, and personal experience rather than RCT data. Surprisingly, limited treatment algorithms based on expert consensus exist in the literature. Regarding prevention of HFS, a skin \ncare regimen with emollients and patient education is often recom -\nmended.\n74 When HFS arises, dose modification or interruption is the \ngold standard, with symptomatic management for pain or erosions.58,68,71 \nPhase III RCT data support the role of prophylactic celecoxib use, \nwhich was found to reduce the frequency and severity of HFS, likely because of its antiinflammatory effects.\n76 Table 41.8 provides a summary \nof reported treatments in the literature.76–93\nDose reductions\nDose modification regimens are based on the individual drug per manufacturers’ and/or phase III RCT guidelines.

However, her WBC and ALC have increased progressively in the subsequent 1-month follow-up.\n\nThe increase in WBC and ALC may be due to the natural progression of CLL or a response to ibrutinib therapy. Ibrutinib has been shown to cause lymphocytosis in some patients, which can be transient and may not necessarily indicate disease progression. In a study by Byrd et al., ibrutinib therapy resulted in an increase in WBC and ALC in the first few months of treatment, followed by a decrease in WBC and ALC in the subsequent months.\n\nTherefore, the next appropriate step in management would be to continue ibrutinib therapy and closely monitor the patient's laboratory results and clinical symptoms. Repeat laboratory tests should be performed at regular intervals, such as every 1-2 months, to assess the patient's response to therapy. If the patient's symptoms worsen or her laboratory results continue to deteriorate, further evaluation with imaging studies or bone marrow biopsy may be necessary to assess disease progression.\n\nIn addition, the patient's hemoglobin and platelet counts should be closely monitored, as cytopenias may develop in some patients receiving ibrutinib therapy.

Ibrutinib is a Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor that has shown efficacy in CLL, particularly in those with high-risk genetic features such as del(17p). The dosage of ibrutinib is 420 mg orally once daily, and it should be continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

            "have inferior outcome.\nCytogenetic abnormalities have been detected on conventional \ncytogenetics in 40–50% of patients. However, a low proliferative \nrate is a limitation for conventional cytogenetics. In the past dec -\nade, FISH using DNA probes has greatly enhanced the ability to \ndetect molecular abnormalities in almost 80% of cases of CLL. 13q \ndeletion is the most common genetic aberration present in CLL \n(55%) followed by 11q deletion (18%), 12q trisomy (16%), and 17p \ndeletion (7%) [125, 126].These abnormalities have been correlated \nwith outcome. Patients with 17p or 11q deletion generally have \nmore advanced disease with frequent splenomegaly, mediastinal, \nand abdominal lymphadenopathy and more extensive peripheral \nlymphadenopathy. Presence of 17p deletion correlates with low \nincidence of IgVH mutation and also resistance to fludarabine therapy. In contrast, patients with leukaemic cells that have mutant \nIgVH genes usually present in an early clinical stage, frequently \nhave 13q14 chromosomal deletions do not have alterations of p53, \ndo not require therapy, and have a long survival [127, 128].\nZeta-associated protein (ZAP-70), a member of the Syk–ZAP-70 \nprotein tyrosine kinase family, is normally expressed in T cells and \nnatural killer cells, and has a critical role in the initiation of T-cell sig -\nnalling. Expression of ZAP-70 has been shown to correlate inversely \nwith IgVH gene mutation [126]. ZAP-70 is commonly measured by \nflow cytometry. A reliable flow cytometry strategy is needed to sepa -\nrate ZAP-70 expression on malignant CLL cells from that of back \nground T- and NK-cell populations. More recently, a whole-genome \nsequencing study by a Spanish Group have identified four recurrent \nmutations in CLL; these are notch 1 (NOTCH1), exportin 1 (XPO1), \nmyeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MYD88), and \nkelch-like 6 (KLHL6). Mutations in MYD88 and KLHL6 are predom -\ninant in cases of CLL with mutated immunoglobulin genes, whereas",
            "study of 325 patients by Dohner and colleagues, a hierarchic model \nconsisting of five genetic subgroups was constructed on the basis of regression analysis of CLL patients with chromosomal aberrations.\n45 \nPatients with a 17p deletion had the shortest median survival time of 32 months and the shortest treatment-free interval (TFI) of 9 months; patients with an 11q deletion followed closely with 79 months \nand 13 months, respectively. The favorable 13q14 deletion group had \na long TFI of 92 months and a median survival of 133 months, and the group without detectable chromosomal anomalies and those with trisomy 12 fell into the intermediate group with median survival of 111 and 114 months, respectively, and TFI of 33 and 49 months, respectively. According to this pivotal study, CLL patients are prioritized \nin a hierarchic order (deletion 17p13 > deletion 11q22-q23 > trisomy \n12 > no aberration > deletion 13q14).\n97 The hierarchic model of \ncytogenetic abnormalities in predicting disease progression with FISH \nhas been further confirmed by other studies. Much less frequently documented abnormalities including MYC translocations have been \nreported in less than 1% of CLL patients, generally with unfavorable prognostic features, short time to treatment, and short survival.\n99 The \nimpact of high-risk interphase cytogenetics relative to disease progres-sion, outside of its association with IGHV-unmutated CLL, in at least \none study had less impact on outcome.\nSelect Gene Mutations\nUnlike other diseases, CLL has not yet had a common driving mutation that contributes significantly to the progression of the disease in a majority of patients. Until recently, the most common and well-characterized mutated gene in CLL was TP53, which often occurred \nin concert with del(17p). The frequency of TP53 mutations and/or \ndeletions at diagnosis of CLL is relatively infrequent (3%–5%) but",

Examina -\ntion of outcome by cytogenetic risk groups showed that patients with high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities including del(11q) and del(17p) had a significantly shorter remission than patients in the groups with good-risk or intermediate-risk cytogenetic findings when cyclophos -\nphamide was given as a single dose. In contrast, patients with del(11q) but not del(17p) had similar outcomes when fractionated cyclophos-\nphamide was administered over 3 days.\n157\nBendamustine\nBendamustine is an exciting therapeutic option for patients with CLL \nthat has dual functionality, both as an alkylating agent and potentially as a nucleoside analogue. It induces DNA damage by impairing the excision repair pathway and also through generation of reactive oxygen \nspecies. The approval of bendamustine resulted from its demonstrated \nsuperiority over chlorambucil in a phase III trial of 319 previously \nuntreated CLL patients. Bendamustine was administered at 100  mg/\nm2 intravenously on days 1 and 2 and chlorambucil was administered \nat a dose of 0.8  mg/kg orally on days 1 and 15 ev ery 4 weeks for six \ncycles. ORR was 68% with 31% CR with bendamustine versus 31% ORR and 2% CR with chlorambucil treatment (P < .0001). The \nmedian PFS was significantly better ( P < .0001) with bendamustine \n(21.6 versus 8.3 months) than chlorambucil, but grade 3 or 4 hema -\ntologic toxicity and severe infections (grades 3 or 4) occurred more commonly with bendamustine. This study established the single-agent activity of bendamustine, and it was further evaluated in various combinations discussed later in this chapter.\n158\nRituximab",

Side effects of idelalisib included rare cytopenias and pneumonia. Approximately 5% of patients \ndeveloped grade 3 or 4 transient liver function abnormalities during \nthe early phase of treatment, which were reversible by withholding therapy and generally did not recur with resumption at a lower dose level.

More recently, massive parallel genome sequencing \nhas allowed the identification of a t(6;7)(p25.3;q32.3) transloca -\ntion in about 30% of ALK− ALCLs, causing down-regulation of \nDUSP22  and up-regulation of MIR29  micro-RNAs [41]. In the \n2008 WHO Classification, the category of enteropathy-associated \nT-cell lymphoma (EATL) was introduced, which is much more \nrestrictive than the enteropathy-type of the 3rd edition by indi -\ncating evidence of coeliac disease (CD). However, a variant of \nEATL (termed type II) was described that can also occur in the \nabsence of risk factors or clinical signs of CD. This is character -\nized by monomorphic small-to-medium sized elements, express -\ning CD8 and CD56, and carrying MYC  amplifications; it likely \nrepresents an entity distinct from EATL. The term ‘subcutaneous \npanniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma’ was restricted to neoplasms of \nperipheral α/β T-lymphocytes, characterized by a five-year OS of \nabout 80% with conservative therapies [42].

            "122\nThe potential diagnoses of NHL, Hodgkin disease (HD), and \nmediastinal germ cell tumor require special consideration. Many NHLs involve the mediastinum; however, there is frequently disease outside the mediastinum at the time of diagnosis. Hodgkin lymphoma is the \nmost common mediastinal lymphoma and frequently manifests with \na bulky anterior mediastinal mass as the primary site of disease. Lymphoblastic lymphomas occur in the mediastinum, generally in adolescents and young adults, and can grow rapidly and cause airway or superior vena cava compression. The diagnosis and management of these lymphomas are covered in other chapters of this book. If a \nprimary mediastinal germ cell is suspected, then a testicular examination \nand laboratory assessment of α-fetoprotein, β-human chorionic \ngonadotropin, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) should be part of the evaluation. Mature teratomas are the most common mediastinal germ cell tumors, and the radiographic appearance on CT can assist in the identification of these tumors.\n119 The management of mediastinal \ngerm cell tumors is similar to the management of other germ cell tumors and is covered in other chapters in this book. The focus of this section will be the management of primary malignancies of the \nmediastinum.\nAnterior Mediastinal Mass: Thymoma\nThe most common tumor of the anterior mediastinum is thymoma, \ncomprising 20% of tumors of the mediastinum. Most patients are older than 40 years, and thymomas occur with equal frequency in men and women.\n119 Approximately 50% of patients with thymoma \nare asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis, and the mass is incidentally detected on an imaging study. Among patients who are symptomatic at diagnosis, the most common symptoms are chest pain, cough, and \ndyspnea related to compression of adjacent structures.\n119,123 Radiographi -\ncally, thymoma is an anterior-superior mediastinal mass that is well \ndefined, encapsulated, and generally homogeneous.124 It may become",

T reatment response should be documented by physical findings and relevant imaging and laboratory studies. End-of-therapy assessment is usually performed 4 to 6 weeks \nafter completion of therapy unless progression is suspected earlier. An \nInternational Working Group workshop held under the auspices of the National Cancer Institute in 1998 standardized response criteria based on the bidimensional measurements of involved nodal groups.\n63\nBecause of incorporation of FDG-PET scanning into standard \nresponse assessment, the response criteria were updated in 200764 and \nagain in 2014, when they were dubbed the Lugano criteria.31 The \nmodern criteria recognize that sites of prior disease may remain mildly enlarged because of residual necrotic tissue or fibrosis, which would have prevented designation of complete response in the CT-scan based \ncriteria. Under the revised criteria, any site of prior disease considered \nnegative by FDG-PET scan is considered in complete response, regardless of residual size.

The patient is recommended to receive rituximab therapy.\n\nWhile treating with rituximab therapy, it is important to monitor the patient's hepatitis B status due to the risk of reactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) during or after immunosuppressive therapy. Rituximab, being an immunosuppressive agent, can increase the risk of HBV reactivation.\n\nThe following recommendations are suggested while treating with rituximab therapy:\n\n1. HBV serology and HBV DNA (PCR) should be checked before starting rituximab therapy.\n2. If HBV DNA is positive, antiviral prophylaxis with agents such as entecavir or tenofovir should be initiated before starting rituximab therapy.\n3. If HBV DNA is negative, HBV serology should be monitored every 3 months during rituximab therapy and for 12 months after completion of therapy.\n4. If HBV serology becomes positive during or after rituximab therapy, HBV DNA should be checked, and antiviral therapy should be initiated promptly.\n5. Liver function tests should be monitored regularly during and after rituximab therapy.\n\nIn addition to the above recommendations, the patient's other medical conditions, such as age and performance status, should be taken into account while deciding the dosage and duration of rituximab therapy.

The choice of chemotherapy regimen depends on various factors, such as the patient's age, performance status, and comorbidities. Commonly used chemotherapy regimens for DLBCL include R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) or DA-EPOCH-R (dose-adjusted etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab).

Similarly, although CT has been studied the most, \npositron emission tomography (PET) should also be briefly mentioned. Given the low proliferative index and metabolic activity in CLL cells, PET is generally not helpful for staging this disease. In general, lymph nodes from CLL patients have little uptake. However, PET may be useful in detecting Richter transformation. In a single-institution study \nof 37 patients, PET identified 10 of 11 patients who had documented \nRichter transformation at tissue biopsy. However, nine patients had false-positive scans.\n86 Thus PET appears to be sensitive for Richter \ntransformation, with a high negative predictive value, but specificity is poor. These results were confirmed in other studies that showed that the median standardized uptake value (SUV) for patients with \nRichter transformation is 10 to 16 and a cutoff of 5 or higher can \npredict for a more aggressive cohort of untreated CLL patients with inferior progression-free survival (PFS).

The pediatric-type follicular lymphomas, typically \nlimited to one site (most commonly lymph nodes in the head and neck area or testis or epididymis) are characterized by effacement of the normal architecture by neoplastic follicles composed of large, expansive, irregular germinal centers with geographic appearance and \nthin or absent mantle zones. Cytologically, the germinal centers are \ntypically composed of monotonous predominantly large centroblasts, with occasional cases showing numerous mitotic figures and a “starry-sky” appearance because of numerous tingible-body macrophages. Most of these cases have morphologically the appearance of grade 2 or grade 3 (WHO) follicular lymphoma, albeit without the prognostic \nsignificance that this grading would have in classical adult follicular \nlymphoma.\nImmunophenotypically, the neoplastic cells express CD20, CD10, \nBCL-6, and in some cases, CD43, and are typically negative for BCL-2.

Approximately 90% of orbital lymphomas are low-grade diffuse proliferations with small monoclonal B cells; \nmost of the remaining 10% manifest as follicular tumors. Rarely, \norbital lymphomas are large-cell, high-grade tumors. Lymphoma classification is based not only on light microscopy, but also on immunophenotyping, genotype analysis, and clinical features.\n391 Orbital \nand adnexal lymphoid proliferations can be accurately categorized into lymphomas and nonlymphomas with the combination of light microscopy, immunohistochemistry, flow cytometric immunophenotyp -\ning, and molecular analysis.

SMZL may be antigen driven in the setting of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, so all newly diagnosed patients \nshould have an HCV serology checked at baseline. In patients with \nactive HCV infection, treatment of the HCV alone leads to remissions in the majority of patients.\n97 Non–HCV-infected patients may be \nobserved if they are asymptomatic without massive splenomegaly or cytopenias.

The syndrome of LPL with high IgM paraprotein is known as Waldenström macroglobulinemia (WM). The underlying \ngenetic defect in WM appears to be the MYD88 L265P mutation, \nwhich can help differentiate it from morphologically similar entities such as marginal zone lymphoma, and creates a rationale for targeted therapy.\n99 Symptoms related to LPL may be caused by adenopathy, \nsplenomegaly, or cytopenias or caused by the IgM paraprotein itself. High IgM levels can produce symptoms of hyperviscosity, includ-ing fatigue or dizziness, and may also be associated with increased \nbleeding, cryoglobulinemia, cold agglutinin anemia, peripheral \nneuropathy, and amyloidosis.\n100 Patients with acute hyperviscosity"

Multiphase CT imaging, CT angiography, and MRI with and without gadolinium contrast material are commonly used in hepatomas. PET is less reliable, \nbecause approximately half—and sometimes more—of hepatomas are \nnot FDG avid. There has been some use of alternative PET tracers such as C-11 acetate to image some hepatocellular cancers, because some FDG-negative tumors are C-11 acetate avid.\n137 Ultrasonography \nalso can be used to assess the liver and guide biopsies.\nMetastatic lesions to the liver also are common, especially in the \nUnited States. For most tumors, CT is the initial method used for \nassessing whether tumor is present. However, FDG-PET is more \nsensitive than CT in detecting liver metastases in common cancers such as colorectal cancer.\n90,92 Thus PET is seeing greater application \nin assessing suspected liver metastases, although ultrasonography, CT, and MRI also are important methods and still are more commonly applied in many centers (Fig. 16.16).\nKidney Cancer\nIn the past, renal cancers were detected with intravenous pyelograms; currently, however, the most common method for detection is CT. Renal cell cancer commonly is detected incidentally because of the widespread use of cross-sectional imaging. Between 25% and 50% of \nsurgically treated renal cell cancers are discovered incidentally.\n138 Renal \nlesions are classified as cysts or solid masses, depending on their \ncharacteristics as shown by imaging. Renal cysts are fluid-filled and appear anechoic with increased through-transmission on ultrasound \nexamination.

Recurrences after surgery are either intrahepatic or extrahepatic, with the most common sites of extrahepatic metastasis \nbeing lung, retroperitoneal lymph nodes, and bone. Clinical manifesta -\ntions include malaise, anorexia, abdominal pain, abdominal fullness \ndue to ascites or mass effect, and/or weight loss. Acute abdominal pain and distention caused by the spontaneous rupture of a superficial tumor with resulting hemoperitoneum is a common presentation of HCC in high-prevalence areas.\n44 This potentially fatal event is a medical \nemergency that warrants early recognition and management.\nBecause a majority of cases of HCC occur in patients with underly -\ning cirrhosis, any worsening of hepatic function in a patient  \nwith previously diagnosed cirrhosis must prompt an evaluation for occult HCC.\nPatient Evaluation\nAll patients with suspected HCC should undergo hepatitis serologic studies, which include testing for hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis B core antibody, and hepatitis C antibody. Patients should also be evaluated for other risk factors for developing HCC. Where applicable, \na polymerase chain reaction quantitative assay should be performed. \nAn assessment of liver function and cirrhosis should be performed; the most commonly used assessment tool with widespread availability is the Child-Pugh score ( Table 77.1).

        "answer": "Based on the information provided, the patient is a 64-year-old man with metastatic prostate cancer, as evidenced by the elevated PSA level, enlarged pelvic lymph nodes, and bone metastases. He has been on bicalutamide for 2 weeks.\n\nThe best treatment plan for this patient would likely involve androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in combination with chemotherapy or radiation therapy. ADT can be achieved through surgical castration or medical castration using luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists or antagonists. Bicalutamide is an anti-androgen that can be used in combination with an LHRH agonist or antagonist for ADT.\n\nOne option for treatment would be to continue the bicalutamide and add an LHRH agonist or antagonist to achieve ADT. This could be combined with chemotherapy, such as docetaxel, which has been shown to improve overall survival in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). The dosage of docetaxel is typically 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks for six cycles.\n\nAlternatively, the patient could be treated with external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) to the bone metastases, in addition to ADT. EBRT can help to alleviate bone pain and reduce the risk of skeletal-related events, such as fractures or spinal cord compression.\n\nIt is important to note that the patient's overall health and preferences should be taken into account when making treatment decisions. Close monitoring and follow-up are also essential to assess treatment response and manage any side effects.\n\nIn summary, the best treatment plan for this patient would likely involve ADT in combination with chemotherapy or radiation therapy. The specific regimen and dosages should be determined by a healthcare provider experienced in treating prostate cancer.",

One of the largest of these studies reported outcomes for more than 2500 men with prostate cancer treated at 11 different institutions with permanent interstitial brachytherapy.\n272 The median follow-up \nfor this group of men with stage T1 or T2 prostate cancer was 63 months, and all were treated with either \n125I or 103Pd without use of \nhormonal therapy. Men with low-risk, intermediate-risk, and high-risk prostate cancer had 8-year actuarial PSA relapse-free survival rates of 82%, 70%, and 48%, respectively, with use of ASTRO criteria. The \ndosimetric quality of the implant was critical to outcome; for men in \nwhom 90% of the prostate (D\n90) received 130  G y or more, the 8-year \nPSA relapse-free survival rate was 93%, whereas for men in which the prostate D\n90 was below 130  G y, the 8-year PSA relapse-free survival \nwas 76%.

This multiarm multistage trial design had at least eight arms, comparing standard ADT alone versus multiple other treatment combinations.\n379 Results of a randomized comparison \n(2:1:1:1) of ADT alone versus ADT plus zoledronic acid versus ADT plus docetaxel versus ADT plus zoledronic acid and docetaxel have been reported.\n380 Eligible patients included those with metastatic",
            "where there is increased bone turnover, such as bone metastases. Ra-223 \nproduces high, linear energy transfer radiation with ultra-short penetra -\ntion (< 100 µm; 2–10 cell diameters), resulting in a highly localized \nantitumor effect on adjacent bone metastases while limiting damage \nto the surrounding normal tissue.82 Ra-223 is now approved for the \ntreatment of bone metastases from castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) after a placebo-controlled randomized phase 3 trial. Ra-223 increased the survival period of patients by 3.6 months and further \nreduced skeletal morbidity over and above a bisphosphonate.\n83 T reat-\nment with Ra-223 was well tolerated and improved QOL with no \nsignificant long-term toxicities identified.84 After regulatory approval \nfor use in late-stage disease, Ra-223 is now being studied earlier in the course of the disease and in combination with both endocrine and cytotoxic agents.\n85\nSystemic Therapy\nSystemic therapy for bone metastases can be directed against the tumor cell to reduce both cell proliferation and, in consequence, the production of cytokines and growth factors. Alternatively, systemic treatment is directed toward blocking the effect of these substances on host cells. \nChemotherapy, biologically targeted agents, and endocrine treatments \nhave direct antitumor effects, but agents such as the bisphosphonates and denosumab are effective by preventing host cells (primarily osteoclasts) from reacting to tumor products. Systemic therapy therefore can have either direct or indirect actions.\nIn general, the direct systemic anticancer treatment for metastatic \nbone disease is the same as that available for other metastatic manifesta -",

Based on the results of this study, the FDA approved sipuleucel-T in April 2010 for men with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic mCRPC. As seen in the \nearlier studies, neither time to disease progression nor PSA response \nrates were improved by sipuleucel-T treatment compared with placebo. Only one sipuleucel-T–treated participant in the IMPACT study had partial radiographic response, and only 8 of 311 (2.6%) men experienced PSA reductions of 50% or greater with sipuleucel-T. Sipuleucel-T was well tolerated, with adverse events such as fatigue, \ninfluenza-like symptoms, chills, low-grade fever, arthralgias and myal -\ngias, and headaches appearing and resolving within 24 to 48 hours of  \ninfusion.\nBone-Targeted Treatments\nMen with metastatic prostate cancer are at increased risk of skeletal \ncomplications for two main reasons. First, chronic androgen deprivation increases bone resorption and reduces bone mineral density, resulting in osteopenia and/or osteoporosis. Second, bone involvement in prostate \ncancer is extremely common and occurs in up to 75% of patients \nwith metastatic disease. Complications of bone metastasis include bone pain, hypercalcemia of malignancy (although rare for prostate cancer), and other skeletal-related events (SREs) including pathologic fractures, need for radiation or surgery to bone, or spinal cord compression.\nZoledronic Acid\nFor several years, intravenous bisphosphonates have served as the mainstay of adjunctive treatment to help maintain skeletal integrity in patients with bone-metastatic prostate cancer. The benefits of bisphosphonates were shown definitively in a landmark phase III \nstudy involving men with mCRPC and asymptomatic or minimally \nsymptomatic bone metastases, in which zoledronic acid was compared against placebo.\n388,389 This study demonstrated fewer SREs in the",

In addition, the tumors were often quite bulky, and \nit was thought that a course of cytoreductive therapy might provide \na more favorable geometry for external irradiation. However, the use of ADT in combination with radiation was not universally accepted throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Radiation therapy techniques were improving, and the results from early case series exploring the benefit of ADT before and/or during radiation therapy were often negative.\n320,321\nIn the early 1980s, two case series reported encouraging results \nwith the use of ADT and external beam radiation therapy to treat men with locally advanced prostate cancer.\n322,323 The RTOG 75-06 \ntrial also found that men with histologically unfavorable prostate cancers who had been treated with ADT and external beam radiation therapy exhibited similar disease-free survival and overall survival rates \nas men with more favorable prostate cancers who did not receive ADT \nalong with radiation therapy.\n324 Since these early experiences, phase \nIII clinical trials have established the local control and survival benefits of ADT given along with external beam radiation therapy for locally advanced prostate cancer.\nRTOG 86-10 was a randomized phase III clinical trial of external \nbeam radiation therapy alone (standard treatment arm) versus neo -\nadjuvant and concomitant total androgen suppression and external beam radiation therapy (experimental treatment arm).\n325 Eligible men \nhad bulky ( >25 cm2) locally advanced prostate cancer (stage T2b–T4, \nN0–N1, M0).
