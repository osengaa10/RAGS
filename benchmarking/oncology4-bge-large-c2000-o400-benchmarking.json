OS remains influenced by stage, performance status, Fuhrman grade, and histologic subtype (e.g., sarcomatoid feature is associated \nwith poor prognosis). Patients at high risk for recurrence after \nnephrectomy include those with positive lymph nodes, high Fuhrman grade, extension beyond the Gerota fascia, or extension into the renal vein or vena cava. The results of S-TRAC suggest for the first time that adjuvant therapy in selected patients may be of benefit. Additional studies of VEGF inhibitors and anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 therapies \nwill further shape this landscape. Cytoreductive nephrectomy for \npatients with metastatic disease may enhance responsiveness to systemic therapy and also remains the standard treatment modality for patients receiving antiangiogenesis and immunotherapy drugs.

This approach has been shown to have comparable long-term oncologic outcomes to radical cystectomy in well-selected patients.\n\nHere is a detailed treatment regimen:\n\n1. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy: A cisplatin-based combination therapy, such as gemcitabine-cisplatin (GC) or methotrexate-vinblastine-Adriamycin-cisplatin (MVAC), should be administered for 2-3 cycles before the start of radiotherapy and concurrent chemotherapy.\n2. Radiotherapy: External beam radiation therapy should be delivered in daily fractions, typically over 5-7 weeks, with a total dose of 64-66 Gy.\n3. Concurrent chemotherapy: Cisplatin should be administered weekly during radiotherapy at a dose of 40 mg/m².\n4. Close follow-up: Regular cystoscopies and imaging studies should be performed to monitor the patient's response to treatment and detect any recurrence early.\n\nIt is essential to note that the patient's tumor characteristics, such as size, location, and associated hydronephrosis, should be carefully evaluated to determine his suitability for bladder-sparing multimodal therapy. Patients with extensive carcinoma in situ (CIS) or hydronephrosis may not be ideal candidates for this approach.\n\nAdditionally, the patient's renal function should be assessed before administering cisplatin-based chemotherapy, as cisplatin requires adequate renal function for safe administration. If the patient cannot tolerate cisplatin, carboplatin may be considered as an alternative, although its efficacy in this setting is not as well-established.\n\nIn summary, bladder-sparing multimodal therapy with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and concurrent chemotherapy is an optimal management strategy for this patient with muscle-invasive bladder cancer who strongly prefers to avoid a urostomy. Close follow-up is necessary to monitor the patient's response to treatment and detect any recurrence early.",

            "evaluation can be reserved for those with diagnosed muscle-invasive disease.\nPRIMARY THERAPY\nPrimary therapy for bladder cancer relies on initial staging from a TURBT (see Fig. 80.6). The clinical stage, which is determined through pathologic evaluation of the TURBT specimen, drives subsequent treatment approaches. In general, bladder cancer can be categorized \ninto three groups: non–muscle-invasive disease (including Ta, Tis and \nT1 cancers), muscle-invasive localized disease, and advanced cancer. T reatment approaches for each are described in detail.\nTransurethral Resection of Bladder Tumor\nTURBT is the foundation of bladder cancer diagnosis, staging, and treatment. It involves a cutting resectoscope loop that can fully eradicate tumors ranging in size from a few millimeters to several centimeters. A bimanual examination should be performed before and after TURBT \nto evaluate for possible presence of fixed disease suggestive of T3 local \ninvasion. With use of a 1-cm cutting loop, resection proceeds in a stepwise fashion, starting with superficial tumor. Once the surgeon reaches the tumor base, additional resection is performed to achieve lateral resection margins and deep resection to include the muscularis propria, important staging tools. To provide a detailed operative account \nand aid further treatment decision making, the surgeon should note \nthe appearance and number of tumors, tumor location, status of the ureteral orifices, and extent of resection (visibly complete or incomplete), and presence or absence of bladder perforation.\nSome clinical circumstances during TURBT warrant particular \nmention.

De Bruin and coworkers \ndemonstrated a significant reduction in the incidence of second breast \ncancers in women treated with mediastinal RT compared with mantle RT for HL, and a meta-analysis of HL trials by Franklin and coworkers showed a marked decrease in second cancers in patients receiving IFRT compared with EFRT.\n32,33 However, because mediastinal nodes are \ninvolved in the majority of patients with HL, most patients undergoing RT for HL continue to have at least modest exposure to the heart, lungs, and breasts regardless of efforts to administer only involved-site \nRT. The 2012 publication of a randomized trial of ABVD alone versus \nradiation-based therapy in limited stage HL showing for the first time a survival advantage in the chemotherapy alone arm, despite an inferior PFS, confirms the need to consider both efficacy and late toxicity in treatment decisions.\n28 Current guidelines and recommendations",
            "In advanced disease, many centres treat patients with intensive \npoly-chemotherapy alone (especially in the absence of bulky disease). Only if a CR is not achieved will localized additive RT be \nused for residual lymphoma after full chemotherapy [311, 312]. The \ntarget in this situation is the residual mass after chemotherapy [313].\nIn advanced-stage HL two PET-based ABVD escalation or \nBEACOPP de-escalation trials aimed at determining the feasibility \nof omitting radiotherapy in interim PET-negative patients. Patients \nwith a [18F] FDG-PET positive residual tumour after the end of \nchemotherapy (escalated BEACOPP or ABVD × 6 or Stanford V) \nshould receive local radiotherapy with 30 Gy [314–316].\nNodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma \nearly-stage IA\nNodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (NLPHL) \n(stage IA) is treated with IFRT alone. The guidelines of the German \nHodgkin Study Group (GHSG) for NLPHL recommend a dose of \n30 Gy as sufficient [317, 318]. All fields are treated with fractions of \n1.8 to 2.0 Gy, depending on the field size and patient tolerance. No \nadvantage has been shown for doses over 30 to 35 Gy, which is the \nrecommended dose to the CTV [319].\nNodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma \n>stage IA\nNLPHL (>stage IA) is treated according to (the same stage) CHL \nwith combined-modality therapy (chemotherapy followed by \nIFRT) [320, 321].\nOngoing clinical trials will help to clarify the role of systemic \nchemotherapy or antibody-based approaches in the treatment of \nthese patients.\nPaediatric Hodgkin lymphoma\nA full review of RT for paediatric HL is beyond the scope of this \nchapter. However, paediatric protocols in both North America and \nEurope have typically prescribed ≈20 Gy to most patients, with \nonly few selected patients with partial response receiving and a RT \ndose of 30 Gy.

CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisolone) has also been proposed as an alternative to ABVD and in a small study of 29 \nolder adult patients treated with CHOP-21, the CR rate was 93% \nwith 2 treatment-related deaths.\n73 Three-year OS and PFS rates were \n79% and 76%, respectively.\nOngoing efforts to incorporate the very active and well-tolerated \ndrug BV into first-line therapy may benefit older patients both in \nterms of improved efficacy and tolerability. Single-agent BV had a \n92% overall response rate (ORR) and 73% CR rate in 27 patients 60 years of age or older with newly diagnosed HL.\n74 Unfortunately, \nthe median remission duration was only 9.1 months, and 30% of patients experienced grade 3 peripheral neuropathy. Preliminary results of combinations of BV with dacarbazine or bendamustine in patients \n60 years of age or older show response rates of 100%, which in early \nfollow-up appear more durable than single-agent BV.\n75 However, despite \ndose reductions, the combination of BV and bendamustine was poorly tolerated in this study of older patients with excessive hematologic and neurologic toxicity. Older patients, regardless of age, should be treated \nwith curative intent unless life-threatening comorbidities are present.\nTherapy of Hodgkin Lymphoma in HIV\nIn the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), outcomes \nand therapy recommendations for HL in HIV-infected individuals mirror those of the non-HIV population.

Additional localized radiotherapy needs to \nbe considered in case of residual lymphoma. Ongoing studies take \ninto account early interim PET to reduce toxicity without losing \nefficacy of treatment. In Germany six cycles of BEACOPPescalated",
            "Therapy of Hodgkin Lymphoma in Older Patients\nApproximately 15% to 20% of all HL occurs in patients older than 60 years of age.\n1 T rends in age-specific, 10-year relative survival of \npatients with HL between 1980 and 2004 show marked increases in all groups but particularly in patients aged 45 to 59 years (51.4% to 76.2%) and 60 years and older (21.6% to 44.9%).\n1 However, patients \naged 60 years and older still have a much worse prognosis than younger patients. Inferior outcomes are attributable to higher IPS scores at diagnosis, as well as comorbid conditions that increase the morbidity and mortality associated with therapy.\n67 Patients older than 60 years \nof age are not candidates for aggressive regimens such as escBEACOPP and are often not eligible for salvage regimens incorporating ASCT. Proctor and coworkers reported a 14% toxic death rate during or \nimmediately after completion of treatment in a series of 35 patients \n60 years of age and older who received standard ABVD chemotherapy.\n68 \nCauses of death were sepsis in 4 patients and bleomycin pulmonary toxicity in 1 patient. Evens and coworkers reported a much higher incidence of bleomycin lung toxicity in patients older than 60 years \nof age, especially those receiving concurrent granulocyte colony-\nstimulating factor (G-CSF).\n69 In this retrospective analysis of 92 HL \npatients aged 60 to 89 years, 32% of patients developed bleomycin lung toxicity, which was associated with a 25% mortality rate. Analysis of the large randomized trial of ABVD versus Stanford V showed the \n5-year FFS for older adult patients was 48% and OS was 58%, sig -\nnificantly worse than for non–older adult patients (FFS, 74%; OS, \n90%).\n70 Interestingly, the time to progression (TTP) was similar for \nyounger and older patients, but deaths without progression were significantly higher in older patients. The GHSG (German Hodgkin Study Group) analyzed the outcomes of patients age 60 years or older",

The risk of developing it is highest within \n6 to 12 months after initiation of cART.107,108 The median age at \ndiagnosis in HIV-infected individuals is older (40 to 44 years) than in others.\n109 In the pre-cART era, the mixed cellularity subtype was \nmost common, but currently the nodular sclerosing subtype constitutes nearly 50% of cases.\n110,111 T reatment follows the same paradigms in \nHIV-negative patients and involves a stage-adapted approach. The most commonly used first-line regimen is ABVD (Adriamycin [doxorubicin], bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine) with or without radiation, \nand outcomes appear generally comparable between HIV-positive and \nHIV-negative patients.\n112,113 Nevertheless, the use of the more intensive \nBEACOPP regimen (bleomycin, etoposide, Adriamycin [doxorubicin], cyclophosphamide, Oncovin [vincristine], procarbazine, and prednisone) for advanced-stage disease is feasible for the majority of HIV-infected \npatients and is associated with excellent outcomes.\n114ifosfamide, etoposide, and high-dose cytarabine)–rituximab regimen \nand the less toxic EPOCH-rituximab regimen is feasible, with 2-year overall survival rates of 69% and 83%, respectively.\n78,79\nPrimary Effusion Lymphoma"
