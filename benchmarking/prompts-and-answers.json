        "q": "A 65-year-old woman is diagnosed with metastatic bladder cancer. She hasa history of hypertension and chronic kidney disease with baseline creatinine of 2. Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) score is <1% and she has a FGFR2 mutation on nex t-generation sequencing. What is the appropriate first-line treatment?",
        "a": "Carboplatin + gemcitabine. Due to her chronic kidney disease (CKD), she would be considered cisplatin-ineligible. Platinum-based treatment would be still be preferable, and therefore carboplatin plus gemcitabine is the preferred regimen. PD-L1 score is too low for upfront checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Given the FGFR2 mutation, erdafitinib could be considered second-line but would not be used for front-line therapy."

        "q": "A 54-year-old man presents with gross hematuria. He undergoes transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT), which diagnoses muscle-invasive (T2) bladder cancer. He has no comorbidities; however, he strongly prefers to not have a urostomy. What would be the optimal management of his bladder cancer?",
        "a": "Chemoradiation with cisplatin and 5-FU. Recommended options for muscle-invasive bladder cancer include cystectomy and chemoradiation. Because this patient prefers to avoid cystectomy, bladder-sparing options should be considered. Chemoradiation with doublet chemotherapy is preferred"

        "q": "An otherwise healthy 45-year-old male completed six cycles of Adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine (ABVD) for stage IV classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL). Six months following completion of treatment, he noticed an enlarging cervical lymph node. Biopsy was performed, which confirmed relapse. PET/CT shows diffuse disease. What is the most appropriate next step in management?",
        "a": "Initiate salvage chemotherapy with ifosfamide/carboplatin/etoposide (ICE) and plan for autologous stem cell transplant (autoSCT). Standard initial treatment for relapsed cHL is salvage chemotherapy (such as ICE) followed by autoSCT. Retreating with a combination chemotherapy regimen without autoSCT would not be indicated with a relapse this early. Brentuximab and allogeneic stem cell transplant are indicated in patients relapsing following autoSCT."

        "q": "An 81-year-old male is diagnosed with stage IVA classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL). He has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 2. He wishes to pursue therapy for his lymphoma if possible but is concerned with quality of life in the setting of his comorbidities and current frailty. He has a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease. Which of the following would be the most reasonable treatment recommendation?",
        "a": "Treatment with combination of brentuximab vedotin and nivolumab. Emerging data have shown the combination of brentuximab vedotin and nivolumab to have high response rates with acceptable toxicity profile in elderly/frail patients with advanced stage cHL."
